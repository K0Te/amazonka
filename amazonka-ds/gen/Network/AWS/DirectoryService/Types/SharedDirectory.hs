-- | Creates a value of 'SharedDirectory' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sSharedAccountId' - Identifier of the directory consumer account that has access to the shared directory (@OwnerDirectoryId@ ) in the directory owner account.
--
-- * 'sOwnerAccountId' - Identifier of the directory owner account, which contains the directory that has been shared to the consumer account.
--
-- * 'sLastUpdatedDateTime' - The date and time that the shared directory was last updated.
--
-- * 'sShareStatus' - Current directory status of the shared AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.
--
-- * 'sShareMethod' - The method used when sharing a directory to determine whether the directory should be shared within your AWS organization (@ORGANIZATIONS@ ) or with any AWS account by sending a shared directory request (@HANDSHAKE@ ).
--
-- * 'sOwnerDirectoryId' - Identifier of the directory in the directory owner account. 
--
-- * 'sSharedDirectoryId' - Identifier of the shared directory in the directory consumer account. This identifier is different for each directory owner account.
--
-- * 'sShareNotes' - A directory share request that is sent by the directory owner to the directory consumer. The request includes a typed message to help the directory consumer administrator determine whether to approve or reject the share invitation.
--
-- * 'sCreatedDateTime' - The date and time that the shared directory was created.
