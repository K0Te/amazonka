-- | Creates a value of 'ConditionalForwarder' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cfDNSIPAddrs' - The IP addresses of the remote DNS server associated with RemoteDomainName. This is the IP address of the DNS server that your conditional forwarder points to.
--
-- * 'cfRemoteDomainName' - The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote domains pointed to by the conditional forwarder.
--
-- * 'cfReplicationScope' - The replication scope of the conditional forwarder. The only allowed value is @Domain@ , which will replicate the conditional forwarder to all of the domain controllers for your AWS directory.
