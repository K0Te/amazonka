-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'isAttributes' - A string map that contains the following information:     * The attributes that are associate with the instance.      * For each attribute, the applicable value. Supported attribute keys include the following:     * @AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME@ : For an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer.      * @AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID@ : (HTTP namespaces only) The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the instance. When the @AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID@ attribute is specified, then the @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4@ attribute contains the primary private IPv4 address.     * @AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME@ : For a @CNAME@ record, the domain name that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries, for example, @example.com@ .     * @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4@ : For an @A@ record, the IPv4 address that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries, for example, @192.0.2.44@ .     * @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6@ : For an @AAAA@ record, the IPv6 address that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries, for example, @2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345@ .     * @AWS_INSTANCE_PORT@ : For an @SRV@ record, the value that Route 53 returns for the port. In addition, if the service includes @HealthCheckConfig@ , the port on the endpoint that Route 53 sends requests to.
--
-- * 'isId' - The ID for an instance that you created by using a specified service.
