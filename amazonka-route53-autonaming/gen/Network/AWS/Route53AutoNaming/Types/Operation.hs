-- | Creates a value of 'Operation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'oStatus' - The status of the operation. Values include the following:     * __SUBMITTED__ : This is the initial state immediately after you submit a request.     * __PENDING__ : AWS Cloud Map is performing the operation.     * __SUCCESS__ : The operation succeeded.     * __FAIL__ : The operation failed. For the failure reason, see @ErrorMessage@ .
--
-- * 'oUpdateDate' - The date and time that the value of @Status@ changed to the current value, in Unix date/time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of @UpdateDate@ is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value @1516925490.087@ represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
--
-- * 'oCreateDate' - The date and time that the request was submitted, in Unix date/time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of @CreateDate@ is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value @1516925490.087@ represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
--
-- * 'oTargets' - The name of the target entity that is associated with the operation:     * __NAMESPACE__ : The namespace ID is returned in the @ResourceId@ property.     * __SERVICE__ : The service ID is returned in the @ResourceId@ property.     * __INSTANCE__ : The instance ID is returned in the @ResourceId@ property.
--
-- * 'oErrorCode' - The code associated with @ErrorMessage@ . Values for @ErrorCode@ include the following:     * @ACCESS_DENIED@      * @CANNOT_CREATE_HOSTED_ZONE@      * @EXPIRED_TOKEN@      * @HOSTED_ZONE_NOT_FOUND@      * @INTERNAL_FAILURE@      * @INVALID_CHANGE_BATCH@      * @THROTTLED_REQUEST@ 
--
-- * 'oId' - The ID of the operation that you want to get information about.
--
-- * 'oType' - The name of the operation that is associated with the specified ID.
--
-- * 'oErrorMessage' - If the value of @Status@ is @FAIL@ , the reason that the operation failed.
