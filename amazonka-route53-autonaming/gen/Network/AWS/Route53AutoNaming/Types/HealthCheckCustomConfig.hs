module Network.AWS.Route53AutoNaming.Types.HealthCheckCustomConfig where

-- | A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following circumstances:
--
--
--     * You can't use a health check that is defined by @HealthCheckConfig@ because the resource isn't available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)
--
--     * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where your resources are.
--
--
--
-- /Important:/ If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either @HealthCheckCustomConfig@ or @HealthCheckConfig@ but not both.
--
-- To change the status of a custom health check, submit an @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request. AWS Cloud Map doesn't monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the most recent @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request.
--
-- Here's how custom health checks work:
--
--     * You create a service and specify a value for @FailureThreshold@ . 
--
-- The failure threshold indicates the number of 30-second intervals you want AWS Cloud Map to wait between the time that your application sends an <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus.html UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus> request and the time that AWS Cloud Map stops routing internet traffic to the corresponding resource.
--
--     * You register an instance.
--
--     * You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource that is associated with the new instance. 
--
--     * The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is unhealthy and notifies your application.
--
--     * Your application submits an @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request.
--
--     * AWS Cloud Map waits for (@FailureThreshold@ x 30) seconds.
--
--     * If another @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request doesn't arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy, AWS Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.

-- * 'hcccFailureThreshold' - /Important:/ This parameter has been deprecated and is always set to 1. AWS Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds after receiving an @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request before changing the status of the service instance. The number of 30-second intervals that you want AWS Cloud Map to wait after receiving an @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request before it changes the health status of a service instance. Sending a second or subsequent @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request with the same value before 30 seconds has passed doesn't accelerate the change. AWS Cloud Map still waits @30@ seconds after the first request to make the change.
