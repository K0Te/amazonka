-- * 'osStatus' - The status of the operation. Values include the following:     * __SUBMITTED__ : This is the initial state immediately after you submit a request.     * __PENDING__ : AWS Cloud Map is performing the operation.     * __SUCCESS__ : The operation succeeded.     * __FAIL__ : The operation failed.
