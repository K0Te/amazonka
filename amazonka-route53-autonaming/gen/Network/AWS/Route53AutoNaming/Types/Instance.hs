-- | Creates a value of 'Instance' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iCreatorRequestId' - A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed @RegisterInstance@ requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. You must use a unique @CreatorRequestId@ string every time you submit a @RegisterInstance@ request if you're registering additional instances for the same namespace and service. @CreatorRequestId@ can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.
--
-- * 'iAttributes' - A string map that contains the following information for the service that you specify in @ServiceId@ :     * The attributes that apply to the records that are defined in the service.      * For each attribute, the applicable value. Supported attribute keys include the following: __AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME__  ____  If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html AliasTarget> . Note the following:     * The configuration for the service that is specified by @ServiceId@ must include settings for an @A@ record, an @AAAA@ record, or both.     * In the service that is specified by @ServiceId@ , the value of @RoutingPolicy@ must be @WEIGHTED@ .     * If the service that is specified by @ServiceId@ includes @HealthCheckConfig@ settings, AWS Cloud Map will create the health check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias record.     * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers.     * If you specify a value for @AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME@ , don't specify values for any of the @AWS_INSTANCE@ attributes. __AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID__  /HTTP namespaces only./ The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the instance. The @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4@ attribute contains the primary private IPv4 address. __AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME__  If the service configuration includes a @CNAME@ record, the domain name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, @example.com@ . This value is required if the service specified by @ServiceId@ includes settings for an @CNAME@ record. __AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4__  If the service configuration includes an @A@ record, the IPv4 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, @192.0.2.44@ . This value is required if the service specified by @ServiceId@ includes settings for an @A@ record. If the service includes settings for an @SRV@ record, you must specify a value for @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4@ , @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6@ , or both. __AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6__  If the service configuration includes an @AAAA@ record, the IPv6 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, @2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345@ . This value is required if the service specified by @ServiceId@ includes settings for an @AAAA@ record. If the service includes settings for an @SRV@ record, you must specify a value for @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4@ , @AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6@ , or both. __AWS_INSTANCE_PORT__  If the service includes an @SRV@ record, the value that you want Route 53 to return for the port. If the service includes @HealthCheckConfig@ , the port on the endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to.  This value is required if you specified settings for an @SRV@ record or a Route 53 health check when you created the service.
--
-- * 'iId' - An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the following:     * If the service that is specified by @ServiceId@ includes settings for an @SRV@ record, the value of @InstanceId@ is automatically included as part of the value for the @SRV@ record. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_DnsRecord.html#cloudmap-Type-DnsRecord-Type DnsRecord > Type> .     * You can use this value to update an existing instance.     * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among instances that you register by using the same service.      * If you specify an existing @InstanceId@ and @ServiceId@ , AWS Cloud Map updates the existing DNS records. If there's also an existing health check, AWS Cloud Map deletes the old health check and creates a new one.
