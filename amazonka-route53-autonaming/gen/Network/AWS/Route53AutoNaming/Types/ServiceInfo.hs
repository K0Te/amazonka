-- | Creates a value of 'ServiceInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'siInstanceCount' - The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances that were previously associated with the service but that have been deleted are not included in the count. The count might not reflect pending registrations and deregistrations.
--
-- * 'siARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Cloud Map assigns to the service when you create it.
--
-- * 'siHealthCheckConfig' - /Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only./ A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, AWS Cloud Map associates the health check with the records that you specify in @DnsConfig@ . For information about the charges for health checks, see <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/ Amazon Route 53 Pricing> .
--
-- * 'siCreatorRequestId' - A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. @CreatorRequestId@ can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.
--
-- * 'siCreateDate' - The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of @CreateDate@ is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value @1516925490.087@ represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
--
-- * 'siHealthCheckCustomConfig' - A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check. /Important:/ If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either @HealthCheckCustomConfig@ or @HealthCheckConfig@ but not both.
--
-- * 'siNamespaceId' - The ID of the namespace that was used to create the service.
--
-- * 'siName' - The name of the service.
--
-- * 'siId' - The ID that AWS Cloud Map assigned to the service when you created it.
--
-- * 'siDNSConfig' - A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.
--
-- * 'siDescription' - The description of the service.
