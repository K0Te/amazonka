-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:

-- * 'ssInstanceCount' - The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances that were previously associated with the service but that have been deleted are not included in the count. The count might not reflect pending registrations and deregistrations.
--
-- * 'ssARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Cloud Map assigns to the service when you create it.

-- * 'ssHealthCheckConfig' - Undocumented member.

-- * 'ssCreateDate' - The date and time that the service was created.
--
-- * 'ssHealthCheckCustomConfig' - Undocumented member.
