Possible Values:     * pending-payment-This reserved node has recently been purchased, and the sale has been approved, but payment has not yet been confirmed.     * active-This reserved node is owned by the caller and is available for use.     * payment-failed-Payment failed for the purchase attempt.     * retired-The reserved node is no longer available.      * exchanging-The owner is exchanging the reserved node for another reserved node.
--
-- * 'rnCurrencyCode' - The currency code for the reserved cluster.
--
-- * 'rnStartTime' - The time the reservation started. You purchase a reserved node offering for a duration. This is the start time of that duration.
--
-- * 'rnNodeCount' - The number of reserved compute nodes.
