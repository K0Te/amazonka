-- | Creates a value of 'ReservedNodeOffering' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rnoReservedNodeOfferingType' - 
--
-- * 'rnoCurrencyCode' - The currency code for the compute nodes offering.
--
-- * 'rnoReservedNodeOfferingId' - The offering identifier.
--
-- * 'rnoRecurringCharges' - The charge to your account regardless of whether you are creating any clusters using the node offering. Recurring charges are only in effect for heavy-utilization reserved nodes.
--
-- * 'rnoOfferingType' - The anticipated utilization of the reserved node, as defined in the reserved node offering.
--
-- * 'rnoUsagePrice' - The rate you are charged for each hour the cluster that is using the offering is running.
--
-- * 'rnoNodeType' - The node type offered by the reserved node offering.
--
-- * 'rnoFixedPrice' - The upfront fixed charge you will pay to purchase the specific reserved node offering.
--
-- * 'rnoDuration' - The duration, in seconds, for which the offering will reserve the node.
