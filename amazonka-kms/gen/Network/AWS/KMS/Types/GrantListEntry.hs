-- | Creates a value of 'GrantListEntry' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gleKeyId' - The unique identifier for the customer master key (CMK) to which the grant applies.
--
-- * 'gleRetiringPrincipal' - The principal that can retire the grant.
--
-- * 'gleIssuingAccount' - The AWS account under which the grant was issued.
--
-- * 'gleGrantId' - The unique identifier for the grant.
--
-- * 'gleConstraints' - A list of key-value pairs that must be present in the encryption context of certain subsequent operations that the grant allows.
--
-- * 'gleGranteePrincipal' - The identity that gets the permissions in the grant. The @GranteePrincipal@ field in the @ListGrants@ response usually contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal in the grant. However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an AWS service, the @GranteePrincipal@ field contains the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#principal-services service principal> , which might represent several different grantee principals.
--
-- * 'gleName' - The friendly name that identifies the grant. If a name was provided in the 'CreateGrant' request, that name is returned. Otherwise this value is null.
--
-- * 'gleCreationDate' - The date and time when the grant was created.
--
-- * 'gleOperations' - The list of operations permitted by the grant.
