-- | Use this structure to allow <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations cryptographic operations> in the grant only when the operation request includes the specified <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context encryption context> . 
--
--
-- AWS KMS applies the grant constraints only to cryptographic operations that support an encryption context, that is, all cryptographic operations with a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#symmetric-cmks symmetric CMK> . Grant constraints are not applied to operations that do not support an encryption context, such as cryptographic operations with asymmetric CMKs and management operations, such as 'DescribeKey' or 'ScheduleKeyDeletion' .
--
-- /Important:/ In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption operation must be an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and values in the encryption context of the encryption operation. Only the order of the pairs can vary.
--
-- However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not case sensitive, but the value is case sensitive.
--
-- To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that differ only by case. To require a fully case-sensitive encryption context, use the @kms:EncryptionContext:@ and @kms:EncryptionContextKeys@ conditions in an IAM or key policy. For details, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-encryption-context kms:EncryptionContext:> in the /\/AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\/ / .

-- | Creates a value of 'GrantConstraints' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gcEncryptionContextEquals' - A list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption context in the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations cryptographic operation> request. The grant allows the operation only when the encryption context in the request is the same as the encryption context specified in this constraint.
--
-- * 'gcEncryptionContextSubset' - A list of key-value pairs that must be included in the encryption context of the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations cryptographic operation> request. The grant allows the cryptographic operation only when the encryption context in the request includes the key-value pairs specified in this constraint, although it can include additional key-value pairs.
