-- | Creates a value of 'KeyMetadata' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'kmOrigin' - The source of the CMK's key material. When this value is @AWS_KMS@ , AWS KMS created the key material. When this value is @EXTERNAL@ , the key material was imported from your existing key management infrastructure or the CMK lacks key material. When this value is @AWS_CLOUDHSM@ , the key material was created in the AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with a custom key store.
--
-- * 'kmExpirationModel' - Specifies whether the CMK's key material expires. This value is present only when @Origin@ is @EXTERNAL@ , otherwise this value is omitted.
--
-- * 'kmKeyManager' - The manager of the CMK. CMKs in your AWS account are either customer managed or AWS managed. For more information about the difference, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys Customer Master Keys> in the /AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'kmCustomerMasterKeySpec' - Describes the type of key material in the CMK.
--
-- * 'kmEnabled' - Specifies whether the CMK is enabled. When @KeyState@ is @Enabled@ this value is true, otherwise it is false.
--
-- * 'kmValidTo' - The time at which the imported key material expires. When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK becomes unusable. This value is present only for CMKs whose @Origin@ is @EXTERNAL@ and whose @ExpirationModel@ is @KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES@ , otherwise this value is omitted.
--
-- * 'kmARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK. For examples, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kms AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)> in the Example ARNs section of the /AWS General Reference/ .
--
-- * 'kmKeyState' - The current status of the CMK. For more information about how key state affects the use of a CMK, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html Key state: Effect on your CMK> in the /AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'kmEncryptionAlgorithms' - The encryption algorithms that the CMK supports. You cannot use the CMK with other encryption algorithms within AWS KMS. This field appears only when the @KeyUsage@ of the CMK is @ENCRYPT_DECRYPT@ .
--
-- * 'kmAWSAccountId' - The twelve-digit account ID of the AWS account that owns the CMK.
--
-- * 'kmSigningAlgorithms' - The signing algorithms that the CMK supports. You cannot use the CMK with other signing algorithms within AWS KMS. This field appears only when the @KeyUsage@ of the CMK is @SIGN_VERIFY@ .
--
-- * 'kmKeyUsage' - The <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations cryptographic operations> for which you can use the CMK.
--
-- * 'kmCreationDate' - The date and time when the CMK was created.
--
-- * 'kmDeletionDate' - The date and time after which AWS KMS deletes the CMK. This value is present only when @KeyState@ is @PendingDeletion@ .
--
-- * 'kmCloudHSMClusterId' - The cluster ID of the AWS CloudHSM cluster that contains the key material for the CMK. When you create a CMK in a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html custom key store> , AWS KMS creates the key material for the CMK in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the CMK is created in a custom key store.
--
-- * 'kmDescription' - The description of the CMK.
--
-- * 'kmCustomKeyStoreId' - A unique identifier for the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html custom key store> that contains the CMK. This value is present only when the CMK is created in a custom key store.
--
-- * 'kmKeyId' - The globally unique identifier for the CMK.
