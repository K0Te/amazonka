-- Deletes a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html custom key store> . This operation does not delete the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, or affect any users or keys in the cluster.
--
--
-- The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys customer master keys (CMKs)> . Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations cryptographic operations> . Then, use 'ScheduleKeyDeletion' to delete the AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the @ScheduleKeyDeletion@ operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key delete the orphaned key material> from the cluster and its backups.
--
-- After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use 'DisconnectCustomKeyStore' to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store.
--
-- Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using 'DisconnectCustomKeyStore' to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store. But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time.
--
-- If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
--
-- This operation is part of the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html Custom Key Store feature> feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.
