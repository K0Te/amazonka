-- Returns the public key of an asymmetric CMK. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric CMK, which never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted, callers with @kms:GetPublicKey@ permission can download the public key of an asymmetric CMK. You can share the public key to allow others to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs> in the /AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide/ .
--
--
-- You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within AWS KMS by calling the 'Encrypt' , 'ReEncrypt' , or 'Verify' operations with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK. When you use the public key within AWS KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For details, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys> .
--
-- To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, @GetPublicKey@ returns important information about the public key in the response, including:
--
--     * <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-CustomerMasterKeySpec CustomerMasterKeySpec> : The type of key material in the public key, such as @RSA_4096@ or @ECC_NIST_P521@ .
--
--     * <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeyUsage KeyUsage> : Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.
--
--     * <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-EncryptionAlgorithms EncryptionAlgorithms> or <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-SigningAlgorithms SigningAlgorithms> : A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.
--
--
--
-- Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation.
--
-- The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key> in the /AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide/ .
