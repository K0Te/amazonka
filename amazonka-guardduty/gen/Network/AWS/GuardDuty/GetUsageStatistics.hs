-- Lists Amazon GuardDuty usage statistics over the last 30 days for the specified detector ID. For newly enabled detectors or data sources the cost returned will include only the usage so far under 30 days, this may differ from the cost metrics in the console, which projects usage over 30 days to provide a monthly cost estimate. For more information see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/monitoring_costs.html#usage-calculations Understanding How Usage Costs are Calculated> .

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gusNextToken' - A token to use for paginating results that are returned in the response. Set the value of this parameter to null for the first request to a list action. For subsequent calls, use the NextToken value returned from the previous request to continue listing results after the first page.
--
-- * 'gusUnit' - The currency unit you would like to view your usage statistics in. Current valid values are USD.

--
-- * 'gusUsageStatisticType' - The type of usage statistics to retrieve.
