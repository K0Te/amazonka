-- Subscribes an endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic. If the endpoint type is HTTP/S or email, or if the endpoint and the topic are not in the same AWS account, the endpoint owner must run the @ConfirmSubscription@ action to confirm the subscription.
--
--
-- You call the @ConfirmSubscription@ action with the token from the subscription response. Confirmation tokens are valid for three days.
--
-- This action is throttled at 100 transactions per second (TPS).

-- | Creates a value of 'Subscribe' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'subReturnSubscriptionARN' - Sets whether the response from the @Subscribe@ request includes the subscription ARN, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed. If you set this parameter to @true@ , the response includes the ARN in all cases, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed. In addition to the ARN for confirmed subscriptions, the response also includes the @pending subscription@ ARN value for subscriptions that aren't yet confirmed. A subscription becomes confirmed when the subscriber calls the @ConfirmSubscription@ action with a confirmation token. The default value is @false@ .
--
-- * 'subAttributes' - A map of attributes with their corresponding values. The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the @SetTopicAttributes@ action uses:     * @DeliveryPolicy@ – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.     * @FilterPolicy@ – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber receive only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every message published to the topic.     * @RawMessageDelivery@ – When set to @true@ , enables raw message delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.     * @RedrivePolicy@ – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the service that powers the subscribed endpoint becomes unavailable) are held in the dead-letter queue for further analysis or reprocessing.
--
-- * 'subEndpoint' - The endpoint that you want to receive notifications. Endpoints vary by protocol:     * For the @http@ protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with @http://@      * For the @https@ protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with @https://@      * For the @email@ protocol, the endpoint is an email address     * For the @email-json@ protocol, the endpoint is an email address     * For the @sms@ protocol, the endpoint is a phone number of an SMS-enabled device     * For the @sqs@ protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon SQS queue     * For the @application@ protocol, the endpoint is the EndpointArn of a mobile app and device.     * For the @lambda@ protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon Lambda function.
--
-- * 'subTopicARN' - The ARN of the topic you want to subscribe to.
--
-- * 'subProtocol' - The protocol you want to use. Supported protocols include:     * @http@ – delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTP POST     * @https@ – delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTPS POST     * @email@ – delivery of message via SMTP     * @email-json@ – delivery of JSON-encoded message via SMTP     * @sms@ – delivery of message via SMS     * @sqs@ – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon SQS queue     * @application@ – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an EndpointArn for a mobile app and device.     * @lambda@ – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon Lambda function.
