-- | A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access. When @BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules@ is set to @true@ , Amazon EMR prevents cluster creation if one of the cluster's security groups has a rule that allows inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an exception using @PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges@ .

-- | Creates a value of 'BlockPublicAccessConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bpacPermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges' - Specifies ports and port ranges that are permitted to have security group rules that allow inbound traffic from all public sources. For example, if Port 23 (Telnet) is specified for @PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges@ , Amazon EMR allows cluster creation if a security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic on Port 23 from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 port ::/0 as the source. By default, Port 22, which is used for SSH access to the cluster EC2 instances, is in the list of @PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges@ .
--
-- * 'bpacBlockPublicSecurityGroupRules' - Indicates whether Amazon EMR block public access is enabled (@true@ ) or disabled (@false@ ). By default, the value is @false@ for accounts that have created EMR clusters before July 2019. For accounts created after this, the default is @true@ .
