-- | Creates a value of 'NotebookExecutionSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'nesStatus' - The status of the notebook execution.     * @START_PENDING@ indicates that the cluster has received the execution request but execution has not begun.     * @STARTING@ indicates that the execution is starting on the cluster.     * @RUNNING@ indicates that the execution is being processed by the cluster.     * @FINISHING@ indicates that execution processing is in the final stages.     * @FINISHED@ indicates that the execution has completed without error.     * @FAILING@ indicates that the execution is failing and will not finish successfully.     * @FAILED@ indicates that the execution failed.     * @STOP_PENDING@ indicates that the cluster has received a @StopNotebookExecution@ request and the stop is pending.     * @STOPPING@ indicates that the cluster is in the process of stopping the execution as a result of a @StopNotebookExecution@ request.     * @STOPPED@ indicates that the execution stopped because of a @StopNotebookExecution@ request.
--
-- * 'nesEditorId' - The unique identifier of the editor associated with the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'nesStartTime' - The timestamp when notebook execution started.
--
-- * 'nesNotebookExecutionId' - The unique identifier of the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'nesNotebookExecutionName' - The name of the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'nesEndTime' - The timestamp when notebook execution started.
