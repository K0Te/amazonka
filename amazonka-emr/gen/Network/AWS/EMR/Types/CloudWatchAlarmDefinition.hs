-- | Creates a value of 'CloudWatchAlarmDefinition' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cwadEvaluationPeriods' - The number of periods, in five-minute increments, during which the alarm condition must exist before the alarm triggers automatic scaling activity. The default value is @1@ .
--
-- * 'cwadNamespace' - The namespace for the CloudWatch metric. The default is @AWS/ElasticMapReduce@ .
--
-- * 'cwadDimensions' - A CloudWatch metric dimension.
--
-- * 'cwadUnit' - The unit of measure associated with the CloudWatch metric being watched. The value specified for @Unit@ must correspond to the units specified in the CloudWatch metric.
--
-- * 'cwadStatistic' - The statistic to apply to the metric associated with the alarm. The default is @AVERAGE@ .
--
-- * 'cwadComparisonOperator' - Determines how the metric specified by @MetricName@ is compared to the value specified by @Threshold@ .
--
-- * 'cwadMetricName' - The name of the CloudWatch metric that is watched to determine an alarm condition.
--
-- * 'cwadPeriod' - The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied. EMR CloudWatch metrics are emitted every five minutes (300 seconds), so if an EMR CloudWatch metric is specified, specify @300@ .
--
-- * 'cwadThreshold' - The value against which the specified statistic is compared.
