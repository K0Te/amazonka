-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceFleetStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ifsState' - A code representing the instance fleet status.     * @PROVISIONING@ —The instance fleet is provisioning EC2 resources and is not yet ready to run jobs.     * @BOOTSTRAPPING@ —EC2 instances and other resources have been provisioned and the bootstrap actions specified for the instances are underway.     * @RUNNING@ —EC2 instances and other resources are running. They are either executing jobs or waiting to execute jobs.     * @RESIZING@ —A resize operation is underway. EC2 instances are either being added or removed.     * @SUSPENDED@ —A resize operation could not complete. Existing EC2 instances are running, but instances can't be added or removed.     * @TERMINATING@ —The instance fleet is terminating EC2 instances.     * @TERMINATED@ —The instance fleet is no longer active, and all EC2 instances have been terminated.
--
-- * 'ifsStateChangeReason' - Provides status change reason details for the instance fleet.
--
-- * 'ifsTimeline' - Provides historical timestamps for the instance fleet, including the time of creation, the time it became ready to run jobs, and the time of termination.
