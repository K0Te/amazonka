-- | Creates a value of 'Cluster' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cluLogEncryptionKMSKeyId' - The AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) used for encrypting log files. This attribute is only available with EMR version 5.30.0 and later, excluding EMR 6.0.0. 
--
-- * 'cluClusterARN' - The Amazon Resource Name of the cluster.
--
-- * 'cluRequestedAMIVersion' - The AMI version requested for this cluster.
--
-- * 'cluEBSRootVolumeSize' - The size, in GiB, of the Amazon EBS root device volume of the Linux AMI that is used for each EC2 instance. Available in Amazon EMR version 4.x and later.
--
-- * 'cluEC2InstanceAttributes' - Provides information about the EC2 instances in a cluster grouped by category. For example, key name, subnet ID, IAM instance profile, and so on.
--
-- * 'cluOutpostARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost where the cluster is launched. 
--
-- * 'cluNormalizedInstanceHours' - An approximation of the cost of the cluster, represented in m1.small/hours. This value is incremented one time for every hour an m1.small instance runs. Larger instances are weighted more, so an EC2 instance that is roughly four times more expensive would result in the normalized instance hours being incremented by four. This result is only an approximation and does not reflect the actual billing rate.
--
-- * 'cluConfigurations' - Applies only to Amazon EMR releases 4.x and later. The list of Configurations supplied to the EMR cluster.
--
-- * 'cluCustomAMIId' - Available only in Amazon EMR version 5.7.0 and later. The ID of a custom Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI if the cluster uses a custom AMI.
--
-- * 'cluAutoScalingRole' - An IAM role for automatic scaling policies. The default role is @EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole@ . The IAM role provides permissions that the automatic scaling feature requires to launch and terminate EC2 instances in an instance group.
--
-- * 'cluSecurityConfiguration' - The name of the security configuration applied to the cluster.
--
-- * 'cluScaleDownBehavior' - The way that individual Amazon EC2 instances terminate when an automatic scale-in activity occurs or an instance group is resized. @TERMINATE_AT_INSTANCE_HOUR@ indicates that Amazon EMR terminates nodes at the instance-hour boundary, regardless of when the request to terminate the instance was submitted. This option is only available with Amazon EMR 5.1.0 and later and is the default for clusters created using that version. @TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION@ indicates that Amazon EMR adds nodes to a deny list and drains tasks from nodes before terminating the Amazon EC2 instances, regardless of the instance-hour boundary. With either behavior, Amazon EMR removes the least active nodes first and blocks instance termination if it could lead to HDFS corruption. @TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION@ is available only in Amazon EMR version 4.1.0 and later, and is the default for versions of Amazon EMR earlier than 5.1.0.
--
-- * 'cluInstanceCollectionType' - The instance group configuration of the cluster. A value of @INSTANCE_GROUP@ indicates a uniform instance group configuration. A value of @INSTANCE_FLEET@ indicates an instance fleets configuration.
--
-- * 'cluReleaseLabel' - The Amazon EMR release label, which determines the version of open-source application packages installed on the cluster. Release labels are in the form @emr-x.x.x@ , where x.x.x is an Amazon EMR release version such as @emr-5.14.0@ . For more information about Amazon EMR release versions and included application versions and features, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/> . The release label applies only to Amazon EMR releases version 4.0 and later. Earlier versions use @AmiVersion@ .
--
-- * 'cluRepoUpgradeOnBoot' - Applies only when @CustomAmiID@ is used. Specifies the type of updates that are applied from the Amazon Linux AMI package repositories when an instance boots using the AMI.
--
-- * 'cluLogURI' - The path to the Amazon S3 location where logs for this cluster are stored.
--
-- * 'cluKerberosAttributes' - Attributes for Kerberos configuration when Kerberos authentication is enabled using a security configuration. For more information see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-kerberos.html Use Kerberos Authentication> in the /Amazon EMR Management Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cluPlacementGroups' - Placement group configured for an Amazon EMR cluster.
--
-- * 'cluRunningAMIVersion' - The AMI version running on this cluster.
--
-- * 'cluMasterPublicDNSName' - The DNS name of the master node. If the cluster is on a private subnet, this is the private DNS name. On a public subnet, this is the public DNS name.
--
-- * 'cluTerminationProtected' - Indicates whether Amazon EMR will lock the cluster to prevent the EC2 instances from being terminated by an API call or user intervention, or in the event of a cluster error.
--
-- * 'cluVisibleToAllUsers' - Indicates whether the cluster is visible to all IAM users of the AWS account associated with the cluster. The default value, @true@ , indicates that all IAM users in the AWS account can perform cluster actions if they have the proper IAM policy permissions. If this value is @false@ , only the IAM user that created the cluster can perform actions. This value can be changed on a running cluster by using the 'SetVisibleToAllUsers' action. You can override the default value of @true@ when you create a cluster by using the @VisibleToAllUsers@ parameter of the @RunJobFlow@ action.
--
-- * 'cluAutoTerminate' - Specifies whether the cluster should terminate after completing all steps.
--
-- * 'cluStepConcurrencyLevel' - Specifies the number of steps that can be executed concurrently.
--
-- * 'cluApplications' - The applications installed on this cluster.
--
-- * 'cluTags' - A list of tags associated with a cluster.
--
-- * 'cluServiceRole' - The IAM role that will be assumed by the Amazon EMR service to access AWS resources on your behalf.
--
-- * 'cluId' - The unique identifier for the cluster.
--
-- * 'cluName' - The name of the cluster.
--
-- * 'cluStatus' - The current status details about the cluster.
