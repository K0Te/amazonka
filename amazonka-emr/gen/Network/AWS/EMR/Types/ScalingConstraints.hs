--
-- * 'scMinCapacity' - The lower boundary of EC2 instances in an instance group below which scaling activities are not allowed to shrink. Scale-in activities will not terminate instances below this boundary.
--
-- * 'scMaxCapacity' - The upper boundary of EC2 instances in an instance group beyond which scaling activities are not allowed to grow. Scale-out activities will not add instances beyond this boundary.
