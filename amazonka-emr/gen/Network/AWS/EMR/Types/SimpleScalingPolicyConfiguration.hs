-- | Creates a value of 'SimpleScalingPolicyConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sspcAdjustmentType' - The way in which EC2 instances are added (if @ScalingAdjustment@ is a positive number) or terminated (if @ScalingAdjustment@ is a negative number) each time the scaling activity is triggered. @CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY@ is the default. @CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY@ indicates that the EC2 instance count increments or decrements by @ScalingAdjustment@ , which should be expressed as an integer. @PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY@ indicates the instance count increments or decrements by the percentage specified by @ScalingAdjustment@ , which should be expressed as an integer. For example, 20 indicates an increase in 20% increments of cluster capacity. @EXACT_CAPACITY@ indicates the scaling activity results in an instance group with the number of EC2 instances specified by @ScalingAdjustment@ , which should be expressed as a positive integer.
--
-- * 'sspcCoolDown' - The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes before any further trigger-related scaling activities can start. The default value is 0.
--
-- * 'sspcScalingAdjustment' - The amount by which to scale in or scale out, based on the specified @AdjustmentType@ . A positive value adds to the instance group's EC2 instance count while a negative number removes instances. If @AdjustmentType@ is set to @EXACT_CAPACITY@ , the number should only be a positive integer. If @AdjustmentType@ is set to @PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY@ , the value should express the percentage as an integer. For example, -20 indicates a decrease in 20% increments of cluster capacity.
