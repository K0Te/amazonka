-- | Creates a value of 'NotebookExecution' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'neStatus' - The status of the notebook execution.     * @START_PENDING@ indicates that the cluster has received the execution request but execution has not begun.     * @STARTING@ indicates that the execution is starting on the cluster.     * @RUNNING@ indicates that the execution is being processed by the cluster.     * @FINISHING@ indicates that execution processing is in the final stages.     * @FINISHED@ indicates that the execution has completed without error.     * @FAILING@ indicates that the execution is failing and will not finish successfully.     * @FAILED@ indicates that the execution failed.     * @STOP_PENDING@ indicates that the cluster has received a @StopNotebookExecution@ request and the stop is pending.     * @STOPPING@ indicates that the cluster is in the process of stopping the execution as a result of a @StopNotebookExecution@ request.     * @STOPPED@ indicates that the execution stopped because of a @StopNotebookExecution@ request.
--
-- * 'neExecutionEngine' - The execution engine, such as an EMR cluster, used to run the EMR notebook and perform the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'neNotebookInstanceSecurityGroupId' - The unique identifier of the EC2 security group associated with the EMR Notebook instance. For more information see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-managed-notebooks-security-groups.html Specifying EC2 Security Groups for EMR Notebooks> in the /EMR Management Guide/ .
--
-- * 'neEditorId' - The unique identifier of the EMR Notebook that is used for the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'neStartTime' - The timestamp when notebook execution started.
--
-- * 'neARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'neOutputNotebookURI' - The location of the notebook execution's output file in Amazon S3.
--
-- * 'neNotebookExecutionId' - The unique identifier of a notebook execution.
--
-- * 'neNotebookExecutionName' - A name for the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'neLastStateChangeReason' - The reason for the latest status change of the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'neEndTime' - The timestamp when notebook execution ended.
--
-- * 'neNotebookParams' - Input parameters in JSON format passed to the EMR Notebook at runtime for execution.
--
-- * 'neTags' - A list of tags associated with a notebook execution. Tags are user-defined key-value pairs that consist of a required key string with a maximum of 128 characters and an optional value string with a maximum of 256 characters.
