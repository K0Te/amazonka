-- | Creates a value of 'FailureDetails' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fdLogFile' - The path to the log file where the step failure root cause was originally recorded.
--
-- * 'fdReason' - The reason for the step failure. In the case where the service cannot successfully determine the root cause of the failure, it returns "Unknown Error" as a reason.
--
-- * 'fdMessage' - The descriptive message including the error the Amazon EMR service has identified as the cause of step failure. This is text from an error log that describes the root cause of the failure.
