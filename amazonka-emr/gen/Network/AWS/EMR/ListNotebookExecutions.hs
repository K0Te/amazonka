-- Provides summaries of all notebook executions. You can filter the list based on multiple criteria such as status, time range, and editor id. Returns a maximum of 50 notebook executions and a marker to track the paging of a longer notebook execution list across multiple @ListNotebookExecution@ calls.

--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lneStatus' - The status filter for listing notebook executions.     * @START_PENDING@ indicates that the cluster has received the execution request but execution has not begun.     * @STARTING@ indicates that the execution is starting on the cluster.     * @RUNNING@ indicates that the execution is being processed by the cluster.     * @FINISHING@ indicates that execution processing is in the final stages.     * @FINISHED@ indicates that the execution has completed without error.     * @FAILING@ indicates that the execution is failing and will not finish successfully.     * @FAILED@ indicates that the execution failed.     * @STOP_PENDING@ indicates that the cluster has received a @StopNotebookExecution@ request and the stop is pending.     * @STOPPING@ indicates that the cluster is in the process of stopping the execution as a result of a @StopNotebookExecution@ request.     * @STOPPED@ indicates that the execution stopped because of a @StopNotebookExecution@ request.
--
-- * 'lneEditorId' - The unique ID of the editor associated with the notebook execution.
--
-- * 'lneTo' - The end of time range filter for listing notebook executions. The default is the current timestamp.
--
-- * 'lneFrom' - The beginning of time range filter for listing notebook executions. The default is the timestamp of 30 days ago.
--
-- * 'lneMarker' - The pagination token, returned by a previous @ListNotebookExecutions@ call, that indicates the start of the list for this @ListNotebookExecutions@ call.
