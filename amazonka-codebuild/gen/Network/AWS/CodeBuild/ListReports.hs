-- | Creates a value of 'ListReports' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lrSortOrder' - Specifies the sort order for the list of returned reports. Valid values are:      * @ASCENDING@ : return reports in chronological order based on their creation date.      * @DESCENDING@ : return reports in the reverse chronological order based on their creation date. 
--
-- * 'lrNextToken' - During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be returned is the value specified in @maxResults@ . If there more items in the list, then a unique string called a /nextToken/ is returned. To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned. 
--
-- * 'lrFilter' - A @ReportFilter@ object used to filter the returned reports. 
--
-- * 'lrMaxResults' - The maximum number of paginated reports returned per response. Use @nextToken@ to iterate pages in the list of returned @Report@ objects. The default value is 100.
