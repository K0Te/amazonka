-- | Creates a value of 'Project' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pSecondaryArtifacts' - An array of @ProjectArtifacts@ objects. 
--
-- * 'pArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the build project.
--
-- * 'pArtifacts' - Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.
--
-- * 'pEnvironment' - Information about the build environment for this build project.
--
-- * 'pCreated' - When the build project was created, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'pSecondarySourceVersions' - An array of @ProjectSourceVersion@ objects. If @secondarySourceVersions@ is specified at the build level, then they take over these @secondarySourceVersions@ (at the project level). 
--
-- * 'pQueuedTimeoutInMinutes' - The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it times out. 
--
-- * 'pCache' - Information about the cache for the build project.
--
-- * 'pSecondarySources' - An array of @ProjectSource@ objects. 
--
-- * 'pSourceVersion' - A version of the build input to be built for this project. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, it must be one of:     * For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.     * For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format @pr/pull-request-ID@ (for example @pr/25@ ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.     * For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.     * For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3): the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use. If @sourceVersion@ is specified at the build level, then that version takes precedence over this @sourceVersion@ (at the project level).  For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-source-version.html Source Version Sample with CodeBuild> in the /AWS CodeBuild User Guide/ . 
--
-- * 'pName' - The name of the build project.
--
-- * 'pVpcConfig' - Information about the VPC configuration that AWS CodeBuild accesses.
--
-- * 'pSource' - Information about the build input source code for this build project.
--
-- * 'pBadge' - Information about the build badge for the build project.
--
-- * 'pLogsConfig' - Information about logs for the build project. A project can create logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, an S3 bucket, or both. 
--
-- * 'pFileSystemLocations' - An array of @ProjectFileSystemLocation@ objects for a CodeBuild build project. A @ProjectFileSystemLocation@ object specifies the @identifier@ , @location@ , @mountOptions@ , @mountPoint@ , and @type@ of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System. 
--
-- * 'pBuildBatchConfig' - A 'ProjectBuildBatchConfig' object that defines the batch build options for the project.
--
-- * 'pEncryptionKey' - The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format @alias/<alias-name>@ ).
--
-- * 'pLastModified' - When the build project's settings were last modified, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'pWebhook' - Information about a webhook that connects repository events to a build project in AWS CodeBuild.
--
-- * 'pDescription' - A description that makes the build project easy to identify.
--
-- * 'pServiceRole' - The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that enables AWS CodeBuild to interact with dependent AWS services on behalf of the AWS account.
--
-- * 'pTags' - A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this build project. These tags are available for use by AWS services that support AWS CodeBuild build project tags.
--
-- * 'pTimeoutInMinutes' - How long, in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed. The default is 60 minutes.
