-- | Contains code coverage report information.

-- Line coverage measures how many statements your tests cover. A statement is a single instruction, not including comments, conditionals, etc.
--
-- Branch coverage determines if your tests cover every possible branch of a control structure, such as an @if@ or @case@ statement.
