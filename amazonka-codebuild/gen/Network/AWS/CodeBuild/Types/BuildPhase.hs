-- | Creates a value of 'BuildPhase' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bpContexts' - Additional information about a build phase, especially to help troubleshoot a failed build.
--
-- * 'bpStartTime' - When the build phase started, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'bpPhaseStatus' - The current status of the build phase. Valid values include:     * FAILED    * The build phase failed.     * FAULT    * The build phase faulted.     * IN_PROGRESS    * The build phase is still in progress.     * QUEUED    * The build has been submitted and is queued behind other submitted builds.     * STOPPED    * The build phase stopped.     * SUCCEEDED    * The build phase succeeded.     * TIMED_OUT    * The build phase timed out.
--
-- * 'bpPhaseType' - The name of the build phase. Valid values include:     * @BUILD@ : Core build activities typically occur in this build phase.     * @COMPLETED@ : The build has been completed.     * @DOWNLOAD_SOURCE@ : Source code is being downloaded in this build phase.     * @FINALIZING@ : The build process is completing in this build phase.     * @INSTALL@ : Installation activities typically occur in this build phase.     * @POST_BUILD@ : Post-build activities typically occur in this build phase.     * @PRE_BUILD@ : Pre-build activities typically occur in this build phase.     * @PROVISIONING@ : The build environment is being set up.     * @QUEUED@ : The build has been submitted and is queued behind other submitted builds.     * @SUBMITTED@ : The build has been submitted.     * @UPLOAD_ARTIFACTS@ : Build output artifacts are being uploaded to the output location.
--
-- * 'bpEndTime' - When the build phase ended, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'bpDurationInSeconds' - How long, in seconds, between the starting and ending times of the build's phase.
