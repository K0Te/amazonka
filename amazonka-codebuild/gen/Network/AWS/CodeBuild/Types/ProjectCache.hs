-- | Creates a value of 'ProjectCache' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pcLocation' - Information about the cache location:      * @NO_CACHE@ or @LOCAL@ : This value is ignored.     * @S3@ : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.
--
-- * 'pcModes' - An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only used for @LOCAL@ cache types. Possible values are:     * LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE    * Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored.      * LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE    * Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images down from the network.      * LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE    * Caches directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache:      * Only directories can be specified for caching. You cannot specify individual files.      * Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.      * Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file. 
--
-- * 'pcType' - The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:     * @NO_CACHE@ : The build project does not use any cache.     * @S3@ : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.     * @LOCAL@ : The build project stores a cache locally on a build host that is only available to that build host.
