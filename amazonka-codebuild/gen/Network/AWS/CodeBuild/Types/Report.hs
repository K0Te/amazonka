-- | Creates a value of 'Report' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rReportGroupARN' - The ARN of the report group associated with this report. 
--
-- * 'rStatus' - The status of this report. 
--
-- * 'rExpired' - The date and time a report expires. A report expires 30 days after it is created. An expired report is not available to view in CodeBuild. 
--
-- * 'rExecutionId' - The ARN of the build run that generated this report. 
--
-- * 'rTruncated' - A boolean that specifies if this report run is truncated. The list of test cases is truncated after the maximum number of test cases is reached. 
--
-- * 'rArn' - The ARN of the report run. 
--
-- * 'rCreated' - The date and time this report run occurred. 
--
-- * 'rName' - The name of the report that was run. 
--
-- * 'rCodeCoverageSummary' - A @CodeCoverageReportSummary@ object that contains a code coverage summary for this report.
--
-- * 'rTestSummary' - A @TestReportSummary@ object that contains information about this test report. 
--
-- * 'rType' - The type of the report that was run.     * CODE_COVERAGE    * A code coverage report.     * TEST    * A test report.
--
-- * 'rExportConfig' - Information about where the raw data used to generate this report was exported.
