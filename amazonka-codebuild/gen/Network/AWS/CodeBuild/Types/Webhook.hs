-- | Creates a value of 'Webhook' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'wBranchFilter' - A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If @branchFilter@ is empty, then all branches are built.
--
-- * 'wLastModifiedSecret' - A timestamp that indicates the last time a repository's secret token was modified. 
--
-- * 'wUrl' - The URL to the webhook.
--
-- * 'wSecret' - The secret token of the associated repository. 
--
-- * 'wFilterGroups' - An array of arrays of @WebhookFilter@ objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one @WebhookFilter@ in the array must specify @EVENT@ as its @type@ .  For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the @filterGroups@ array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass. 
--
-- * 'wPayloadURL' - The AWS CodeBuild endpoint where webhook events are sent.
--
-- * 'wBuildType' - Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.
