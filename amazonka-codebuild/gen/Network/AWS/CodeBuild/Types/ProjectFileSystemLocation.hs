-- | Creates a value of 'ProjectFileSystemLocation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pfslLocation' - A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is @efs-dns-name:/directory-path@ . You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the AWS EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is @fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com@ , and its mount directory is @my-efs-mount-directory@ , then the @location@ is @fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory@ .  The directory path in the format @efs-dns-name:/directory-path@ is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system. 
--
-- * 'pfslIdentifier' - The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the @identifier@ in all capital letters to @CODEBUILD_@ . For example, if you specify @my_efs@ for @identifier@ , a new environment variable is create named @CODEBUILD_MY_EFS@ .  The @identifier@ is used to mount your file system. 
--
-- * 'pfslMountOptions' - The mount options for a file system created by AWS EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are @nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2@ . For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-nfs-mount-settings.html Recommended NFS Mount Options> . 
--
-- * 'pfslType' - The type of the file system. The one supported type is @EFS@ . 
--
-- * 'pfslMountPoint' - The location in the container where you mount the file system.
