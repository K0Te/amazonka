-- | Creates a value of 'BuildBatchPhase' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bbpContexts' - Additional information about the batch build phase. Especially to help troubleshoot a failed btach build.
--
-- * 'bbpStartTime' - When the batch build phase started, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'bbpPhaseStatus' - The current status of the batch build phase. Valid values include:     * FAILED    * The build phase failed.     * FAULT    * The build phase faulted.     * IN_PROGRESS    * The build phase is still in progress.     * QUEUED    * The build has been submitted and is queued behind other submitted builds.     * STOPPED    * The build phase stopped.     * SUCCEEDED    * The build phase succeeded.     * TIMED_OUT    * The build phase timed out.
--
-- * 'bbpPhaseType' - The name of the batch build phase. Valid values include:     * COMBINE_ARTIFACTS    * Build output artifacts are being combined and uploaded to the output location.     * DOWNLOAD_BATCHSPEC    * The batch build specification is being downloaded.     * FAILED    * One or more of the builds failed.     * IN_PROGRESS    * The batch build is in progress.     * STOPPED    * The batch build was stopped.     * SUBMITTED    * The btach build has been submitted.     * SUCCEEDED    * The batch build succeeded.
--
-- * 'bbpEndTime' - When the batch build phase ended, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'bbpDurationInSeconds' - How long, in seconds, between the starting and ending times of the batch build's phase.
