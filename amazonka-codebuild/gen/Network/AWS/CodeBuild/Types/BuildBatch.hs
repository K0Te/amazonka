-- | Creates a value of 'BuildBatch' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bbPhases' - An array of @BuildBatchPhase@ objects the specify the phases of the batch build.
--
-- * 'bbSecondaryArtifacts' - An array of @BuildArtifacts@ objects the define the build artifacts for this batch build.
--
-- * 'bbBuildTimeoutInMinutes' - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the build in a batch must be completed in.
--
-- * 'bbArn' - The ARN of the batch build.
--
-- * 'bbStartTime' - The date and time that the batch build started.
--
-- * 'bbArtifacts' - A @BuildArtifacts@ object the defines the build artifacts for this batch build.
--
-- * 'bbEnvironment' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bbInitiator' - The entity that started the batch build. Valid values include:     * If AWS CodePipeline started the build, the pipeline's name (for example, @codepipeline/my-demo-pipeline@ ).     * If an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user started the build, the user's name.     * If the Jenkins plugin for AWS CodeBuild started the build, the string @CodeBuild-Jenkins-Plugin@ .
--
-- * 'bbSecondarySourceVersions' - An array of @ProjectSourceVersion@ objects. Each @ProjectSourceVersion@ must be one of:      * For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.     * For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format @pr/pull-request-ID@ (for example, @pr/25@ ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.     * For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.     * For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3): the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.
--
-- * 'bbBuildBatchStatus' - The status of the batch build.
--
-- * 'bbCurrentPhase' - The current phase of the batch build.
--
-- * 'bbBuildBatchNumber' - The number of the batch build. For each project, the @buildBatchNumber@ of its first batch build is @1@ . The @buildBatchNumber@ of each subsequent batch build is incremented by @1@ . If a batch build is deleted, the @buildBatchNumber@ of other batch builds does not change.
--
-- * 'bbQueuedTimeoutInMinutes' - Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, that the batch build is allowed to be queued before it times out.
--
-- * 'bbCache' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bbSecondarySources' - An array of @ProjectSource@ objects that define the sources for the batch build.
--
-- * 'bbSourceVersion' - The identifier of the version of the source code to be built.
--
-- * 'bbResolvedSourceVersion' - The identifier of the resolved version of this batch build's source code.     * For AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and BitBucket, the commit ID.     * For AWS CodePipeline, the source revision provided by AWS CodePipeline.     * For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), this does not apply.
--
-- * 'bbVpcConfig' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bbEndTime' - The date and time that the batch build ended.
--
-- * 'bbProjectName' - The name of the batch build project.
--
-- * 'bbBuildGroups' - An array of @BuildGroup@ objects that define the build groups for the batch build.
--
-- * 'bbSource' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bbId' - The identifier of the batch build.
--
-- * 'bbFileSystemLocations' - An array of @ProjectFileSystemLocation@ objects for the batch build project. A @ProjectFileSystemLocation@ object specifies the @identifier@ , @location@ , @mountOptions@ , @mountPoint@ , and @type@ of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System. 
--
-- * 'bbBuildBatchConfig' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bbEncryptionKey' - The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the batch build output artifacts. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format @alias/<alias-name>@ ).
--
-- * 'bbLogConfig' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bbServiceRole' - The name of a service role used for builds in the batch.
--
-- * 'bbComplete' - Indicates if the batch build is complete.
