--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bgIdentifier' - Contains the identifier of the build group.
--
-- * 'bgDependsOn' - An array of strings that contain the identifiers of the build groups that this build group depends on.
--
-- * 'bgIgnoreFailure' - Specifies if failures in this build group can be ignored.
--
-- * 'bgCurrentBuildSummary' - A @BuildSummary@ object that contains a summary of the current build group.
--
-- * 'bgPriorBuildSummaryList' - An array of @BuildSummary@ objects that contain summaries of previous build groups.
