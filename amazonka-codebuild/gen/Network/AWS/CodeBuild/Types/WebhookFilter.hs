-- | Creates a value of 'WebhookFilter' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'wfExcludeMatchedPattern' - Used to indicate that the @pattern@ determines which webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not match the @pattern@ triggers a build. If false, then a webhook event that matches the @pattern@ triggers a build. 
--
-- * 'wfType' - The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter types: @EVENT@ , @ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID@ , @HEAD_REF@ , @BASE_REF@ , @FILE_PATH@ , and @COMMIT_MESSAGE@ .      * EVENT     * A webhook event triggers a build when the provided @pattern@ matches one of five event types: @PUSH@ , @PULL_REQUEST_CREATED@ , @PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED@ , @PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED@ , and @PULL_REQUEST_MERGED@ . The @EVENT@ patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, @PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED@ filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events.      * ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID     * A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression @pattern@ .      * HEAD_REF     * A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression @pattern@ . For example, @refs/heads/branch-name@ and @refs/tags/tag-name@ .  Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events.      * BASE_REF     * A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression @pattern@ . For example, @refs/heads/branch-name@ .      * FILE_PATH     * A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression @pattern@ .      * COMMIT_MESSAGE    * A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression @pattern@ .
--
-- * 'wfPattern' - For a @WebHookFilter@ that uses @EVENT@ type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter @PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED@ allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build.  For a @WebHookFilter@ that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a @WebHookFilter@ that uses @HEAD_REF@ for its @type@ and the pattern @^refs/heads/@ triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name @refs/heads/branch-name@ .
