-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rgStatus' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'rgArn' - The ARN of a @ReportGroup@ . 
--
-- * 'rgCreated' - The date and time this @ReportGroup@ was created. 
--
-- * 'rgName' - The name of a @ReportGroup@ . 
--
-- * 'rgType' - The type of the @ReportGroup@ . The one valid value is @TEST@ . 
--
-- * 'rgLastModified' - The date and time this @ReportGroup@ was last modified. 
--
-- * 'rgExportConfig' - Information about the destination where the raw data of this @ReportGroup@ is exported. 
--
-- * 'rgTags' - A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this report group.  These tags are available for use by AWS services that support AWS CodeBuild report group tags.
