-- | Creates a value of 'BuildSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bsSecondaryArtifacts' - An array of @ResolvedArtifact@ objects that represents the secondary build artifacts for the build group.
--
-- * 'bsPrimaryArtifact' - A @ResolvedArtifact@ object that represents the primary build artifacts for the build group.
--
-- * 'bsArn' - The batch build ARN.
--
-- * 'bsBuildStatus' - The status of the build group.     * FAILED    * The build group failed.     * FAULT    * The build group faulted.     * IN_PROGRESS    * The build group is still in progress.     * STOPPED    * The build group stopped.     * SUCCEEDED    * The build group succeeded.     * TIMED_OUT    * The build group timed out.
--
-- * 'bsRequestedOn' - When the build was started, expressed in Unix time format.
