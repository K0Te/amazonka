-- | Creates a value of 'BuildArtifacts' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'baLocation' - Information about the location of the build artifacts.
--
-- * 'baMd5sum' - The MD5 hash of the build artifact. You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file integrity and authenticity.
--
-- * 'baEncryptionDisabled' - Information that tells you if encryption for build artifacts is disabled. 
--
-- * 'baOverrideArtifactName' - If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 
--
-- * 'baArtifactIdentifier' - An identifier for this artifact definition. 
--
-- * 'baSha256sum' - The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact. You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file integrity and authenticity.
