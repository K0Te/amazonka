-- | Creates a value of 'TestCase' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tcDurationInNanoSeconds' - The number of nanoseconds it took to run this test case. 
--
-- * 'tcStatus' - The status returned by the test case after it was run. Valid statuses are @SUCCEEDED@ , @FAILED@ , @ERROR@ , @SKIPPED@ , and @UNKNOWN@ . 
--
-- * 'tcExpired' - The date and time a test case expires. A test case expires 30 days after it is created. An expired test case is not available to view in CodeBuild. 
--
-- * 'tcPrefix' - A string that is applied to a series of related test cases. CodeBuild generates the prefix. The prefix depends on the framework used to generate the tests. 
--
-- * 'tcName' - The name of the test case. 
--
-- * 'tcTestRawDataPath' - The path to the raw data file that contains the test result. 
--
-- * 'tcMessage' - A message associated with a test case. For example, an error message or stack trace. 
--
-- * 'tcReportARN' - The ARN of the report to which the test case belongs.
