-- | Creates a value of 'ListSharedProjects' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lspSortOrder' - The order in which to list shared build projects. Valid values include:     * @ASCENDING@ : List in ascending order.     * @DESCENDING@ : List in descending order.
--
-- * 'lspNextToken' - During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be returned is the value specified in @maxResults@ . If there more items in the list, then a unique string called a /nextToken/ is returned. To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned. 
--
-- * 'lspMaxResults' - The maximum number of paginated shared build projects returned per response. Use @nextToken@ to iterate pages in the list of returned @Project@ objects. The default value is 100. 
--
-- * 'lspSortBy' - The criterion to be used to list build projects shared with the current AWS account or user. Valid values include:      * @ARN@ : List based on the ARN.      * @MODIFIED_TIME@ : List based on when information about the shared project was last changed.
