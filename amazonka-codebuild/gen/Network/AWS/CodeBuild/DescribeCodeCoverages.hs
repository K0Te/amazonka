--
-- * 'dccMinLineCoveragePercentage' - The minimum line coverage percentage to report.
--
-- * 'dccSortOrder' - Specifies if the results are sorted in ascending or descending order.
--
-- * 'dccMaxLineCoveragePercentage' - The maximum line coverage percentage to report.
--
-- * 'dccNextToken' - The @nextToken@ value returned from a previous call to @DescribeCodeCoverages@ . This specifies the next item to return. To return the beginning of the list, exclude this parameter.
--
-- * 'dccMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return.
--
-- * 'dccSortBy' - Specifies how the results are sorted. Possible values are:     * FILE_PATH    * The results are sorted by file path.     * LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE    * The results are sorted by the percentage of lines that are covered.
