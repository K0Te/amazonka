-- | Creates a value of 'Backup' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bEngineVersion' - The engine version that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bServiceRoleARN' - The service role ARN that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bStatus' - The status of a backup while in progress. 
--
-- * 'bInstanceProfileARN' - The EC2 instance profile ARN that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. Because this value is stored, you are not required to provide the InstanceProfileArn again if you restore a backup. 
--
-- * 'bSecurityGroupIds' - The security group IDs that are obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bStatusDescription' - An informational message about backup status. 
--
-- * 'bServerName' - The name of the server from which the backup was made. 
--
-- * 'bSubnetIds' - The subnet IDs that are obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bKeyPair' - The key pair that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bCreatedAt' - The time stamp when the backup was created in the database. Example: @2016-07-29T13:38:47.520Z@ 
--
-- * 'bBackupId' - The generated ID of the backup. Example: @myServerName-yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS@ 
--
-- * 'bEngine' - The engine type that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bInstanceType' - The instance type that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bEngineModel' - The engine model that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bPreferredMaintenanceWindow' - The preferred maintenance period that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bUserARN' - The IAM user ARN of the requester for manual backups. This field is empty for automated backups. 
--
-- * 'bPreferredBackupWindow' - The preferred backup period that is obtained from the server when the backup is created. 
--
-- * 'bS3LogURL' - The Amazon S3 URL of the backup's log file. 
--
-- * 'bS3DataSize' - This field is deprecated and is no longer used. 
--
-- * 'bBackupARN' - The ARN of the backup. 
--
-- * 'bS3DataURL' - This field is deprecated and is no longer used. 
--
-- * 'bDescription' - A user-provided description for a manual backup. This field is empty for automated backups. 
--
-- * 'bBackupType' - The backup type. Valid values are @automated@ or @manual@ .
