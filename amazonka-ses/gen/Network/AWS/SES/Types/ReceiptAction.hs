-- | Creates a value of 'ReceiptAction' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'raAddHeaderAction' - Adds a header to the received email.
--
-- * 'raSNSAction' - Publishes the email content within a notification to Amazon SNS.
--
-- * 'raWorkmailAction' - Calls Amazon WorkMail and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon Amazon SNS.
--
-- * 'raBounceAction' - Rejects the received email by returning a bounce response to the sender and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
--
-- * 'raLambdaAction' - Calls an AWS Lambda function, and optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon SNS.
--
-- * 'raStopAction' - Terminates the evaluation of the receipt rule set and optionally publishes a notification to Amazon SNS.
--
-- * 'raS3Action' - Saves the received message to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon SNS.
