-- | Creates a value of 'BouncedRecipientInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'briBounceType' - The reason for the bounce. You must provide either this parameter or @RecipientDsnFields@ .
--
-- * 'briRecipientDsnFields' - Recipient-related DSN fields, most of which would normally be filled in automatically when provided with a @BounceType@ . You must provide either this parameter or @BounceType@ .
--
-- * 'briRecipientARN' - This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to receive email for the recipient of the bounced email. For more information about sending authorization, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html Amazon SES Developer Guide> .
--
-- * 'briRecipient' - The email address of the recipient of the bounced email.
