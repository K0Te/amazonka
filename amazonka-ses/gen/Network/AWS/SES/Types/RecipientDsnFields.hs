-- | Creates a value of 'RecipientDsnFields' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rdfDiagnosticCode' - An extended explanation of what went wrong; this is usually an SMTP response. See <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3463 RFC 3463> for the correct formatting of this parameter.
--
-- * 'rdfRemoteMta' - The MTA to which the remote MTA attempted to deliver the message, formatted as specified in <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3464 RFC 3464> (@mta-name-type; mta-name@ ). This parameter typically applies only to propagating synchronous bounces.
--
-- * 'rdfFinalRecipient' - The email address that the message was ultimately delivered to. This corresponds to the @Final-Recipient@ in the DSN. If not specified, @FinalRecipient@ will be set to the @Recipient@ specified in the @BouncedRecipientInfo@ structure. Either @FinalRecipient@ or the recipient in @BouncedRecipientInfo@ must be a recipient of the original bounced message.
--
-- * 'rdfExtensionFields' - Additional X-headers to include in the DSN.
--
-- * 'rdfLastAttemptDate' - The time the final delivery attempt was made, in <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt RFC 822> date-time format.
--
-- * 'rdfAction' - The action performed by the reporting mail transfer agent (MTA) as a result of its attempt to deliver the message to the recipient address. This is required by <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3464 RFC 3464> .
--
-- * 'rdfStatus' - The status code that indicates what went wrong. This is required by <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3464 RFC 3464> .
