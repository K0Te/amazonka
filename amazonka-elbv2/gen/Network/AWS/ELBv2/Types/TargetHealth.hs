-- | Creates a value of 'TargetHealth' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'thState' - The state of the target.
--
-- * 'thReason' - The reason code. If the target state is @healthy@ , a reason code is not provided. If the target state is @initial@ , the reason code can be one of the following values:     * @Elb.RegistrationInProgress@ - The target is in the process of being registered with the load balancer.     * @Elb.InitialHealthChecking@ - The load balancer is still sending the target the minimum number of health checks required to determine its health status. If the target state is @unhealthy@ , the reason code can be one of the following values:     * @Target.ResponseCodeMismatch@ - The health checks did not return an expected HTTP code. Applies only to Application Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers.     * @Target.Timeout@ - The health check requests timed out. Applies only to Application Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers.     * @Target.FailedHealthChecks@ - The load balancer received an error while establishing a connection to the target or the target response was malformed.     * @Elb.InternalError@ - The health checks failed due to an internal error. Applies only to Application Load Balancers. If the target state is @unused@ , the reason code can be one of the following values:     * @Target.NotRegistered@ - The target is not registered with the target group.     * @Target.NotInUse@ - The target group is not used by any load balancer or the target is in an Availability Zone that is not enabled for its load balancer.     * @Target.InvalidState@ - The target is in the stopped or terminated state.     * @Target.IpUnusable@ - The target IP address is reserved for use by a load balancer. If the target state is @draining@ , the reason code can be the following value:     * @Target.DeregistrationInProgress@ - The target is in the process of being deregistered and the deregistration delay period has not expired. If the target state is @unavailable@ , the reason code can be the following value:     * @Target.HealthCheckDisabled@ - Health checks are disabled for the target group. Applies only to Application Load Balancers.     * @Elb.InternalError@ - Target health is unavailable due to an internal error. Applies only to Network Load Balancers.
--
-- * 'thDescription' - A description of the target health that provides additional details. If the state is @healthy@ , a description is not provided.
