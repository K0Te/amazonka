-- | Creates a value of 'Rule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rPriority' - The priority.
--
-- * 'rActions' - The actions. Each rule must include exactly one of the following types of actions: @forward@ , @redirect@ , or @fixed-response@ , and it must be the last action to be performed.
--
-- * 'rConditions' - The conditions. Each rule can include zero or one of the following conditions: @http-request-method@ , @host-header@ , @path-pattern@ , and @source-ip@ , and zero or more of the following conditions: @http-header@ and @query-string@ .
--
-- * 'rRuleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.
--
-- * 'rIsDefault' - Indicates whether this is the default rule.
