-- | Creates a value of 'TargetGroup' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tgProtocolVersion' - [HTTP/HTTPS protocol] The protocol version. The possible values are @GRPC@ , @HTTP1@ , and @HTTP2@ .
--
-- * 'tgMatcher' - The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target.
--
-- * 'tgHealthCheckPath' - The destination for health checks on the targets.
--
-- * 'tgHealthCheckEnabled' - Indicates whether health checks are enabled.
--
-- * 'tgUnhealthyThresholdCount' - The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering the target unhealthy.
--
-- * 'tgVPCId' - The ID of the VPC for the targets.
--
-- * 'tgTargetGroupARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.
--
-- * 'tgProtocol' - The protocol to use for routing traffic to the targets.
--
-- * 'tgHealthCheckIntervalSeconds' - The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target.
--
-- * 'tgTargetType' - The type of target that you must specify when registering targets with this target group. The possible values are @instance@ (register targets by instance ID), @ip@ (register targets by IP address), or @lambda@ (register a single Lambda function as a target).
--
-- * 'tgHealthyThresholdCount' - The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy.
--
-- * 'tgHealthCheckProtocol' - The protocol to use to connect with the target. The GENEVE, TLS, UDP, and TCP_UDP protocols are not supported for health checks.
--
-- * 'tgLoadBalancerARNs' - The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the load balancers that route traffic to this target group.
--
-- * 'tgHealthCheckTimeoutSeconds' - The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check.
--
-- * 'tgHealthCheckPort' - The port to use to connect with the target.
--
-- * 'tgTargetGroupName' - The name of the target group.
--
-- * 'tgPort' - The port on which the targets are listening. Not used if the target is a Lambda function.
