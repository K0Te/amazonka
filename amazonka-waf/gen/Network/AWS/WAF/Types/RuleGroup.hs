-- | A collection of predefined rules that you can add to a web ACL.

-- Rule groups are subject to the following limits:
--
--     * Three rule groups per account. You can request an increase to this limit by contacting customer support.
--
--     * One rule group per web ACL.
--
--     * Ten rules per rule group.

-- | Creates a value of 'RuleGroup' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rgMetricName' - A friendly name or description for the metrics for this @RuleGroup@ . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric after you create the @RuleGroup@ .
--
-- * 'rgName' - The friendly name or description for the @RuleGroup@ . You can't change the name of a @RuleGroup@ after you create it.
--
-- * 'rgRuleGroupId' - A unique identifier for a @RuleGroup@ . You use @RuleGroupId@ to get more information about a @RuleGroup@ (see 'GetRuleGroup' ), update a @RuleGroup@ (see 'UpdateRuleGroup' ), insert a @RuleGroup@ into a @WebACL@ or delete a one from a @WebACL@ (see 'UpdateWebACL' ), or delete a @RuleGroup@ from AWS WAF (see 'DeleteRuleGroup' ). @RuleGroupId@ is returned by 'CreateRuleGroup' and by 'ListRuleGroups' .
