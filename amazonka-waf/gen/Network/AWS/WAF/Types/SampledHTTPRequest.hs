-- | Creates a value of 'SampledHTTPRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'shttprRuleWithinRuleGroup' - This value is returned if the @GetSampledRequests@ request specifies the ID of a @RuleGroup@ rather than the ID of an individual rule. @RuleWithinRuleGroup@ is the rule within the specified @RuleGroup@ that matched the request listed in the response.
--
-- * 'shttprAction' - The action for the @Rule@ that the request matched: @ALLOW@ , @BLOCK@ , or @COUNT@ .
--
-- * 'shttprTimestamp' - The time at which AWS WAF received the request from your AWS resource, in Unix time format (in seconds).
--
-- * 'shttprRequest' - A complex type that contains detailed information about the request.
--
-- * 'shttprWeight' - A value that indicates how one result in the response relates proportionally to other results in the response. A result that has a weight of @2@ represents roughly twice as many CloudFront web requests as a result that has a weight of @1@ .
