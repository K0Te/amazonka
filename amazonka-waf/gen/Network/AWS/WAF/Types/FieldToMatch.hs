-- | Creates a value of 'FieldToMatch' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ftmData' - When the value of @Type@ is @HEADER@ , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, @User-Agent@ or @Referer@ . The name of the header is not case sensitive. When the value of @Type@ is @SINGLE_QUERY_ARG@ , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, @UserName@ or @SalesRegion@ . The parameter name is not case sensitive. If the value of @Type@ is any other value, omit @Data@ .
--
-- * 'ftmType' - The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:     * @HEADER@ : A specified request header, for example, the value of the @User-Agent@ or @Referer@ header. If you choose @HEADER@ for the type, specify the name of the header in @Data@ .     * @METHOD@ : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: @DELETE@ , @GET@ , @HEAD@ , @OPTIONS@ , @PATCH@ , @POST@ , and @PUT@ .     * @QUERY_STRING@ : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a @?@ character, if any.     * @URI@ : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, @/images/daily-ad.jpg@ .     * @BODY@ : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first @8192@ bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see 'CreateSizeConstraintSet' .      * @SINGLE_QUERY_ARG@ : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as /UserName/ or /SalesRegion/ . The maximum length for @SINGLE_QUERY_ARG@ is 30 characters.     * @ALL_QUERY_ARGS@ : Similar to @SINGLE_QUERY_ARG@ , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in @TargetString@ .
