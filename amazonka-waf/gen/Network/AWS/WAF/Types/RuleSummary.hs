-- | Creates a value of 'RuleSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rsRuleId' - A unique identifier for a @Rule@ . You use @RuleId@ to get more information about a @Rule@ (see 'GetRule' ), update a @Rule@ (see 'UpdateRule' ), insert a @Rule@ into a @WebACL@ or delete one from a @WebACL@ (see 'UpdateWebACL' ), or delete a @Rule@ from AWS WAF (see 'DeleteRule' ). @RuleId@ is returned by 'CreateRule' and by 'ListRules' .
--
-- * 'rsName' - A friendly name or description of the 'Rule' . You can't change the name of a @Rule@ after you create it.
