-- | A combination of 'ByteMatchSet' , 'IPSet' , and/or 'SqlInjectionMatchSet' objects that identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, you might create a @Rule@ that includes the following predicates:
--
--
--     * An @IPSet@ that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests that originate from the IP address @192.0.2.44@ 
--
--     * A @ByteMatchSet@ that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests for which the value of the @User-Agent@ header is @BadBot@ .
--
--
--
-- To match the settings in this @Rule@ , a request must originate from @192.0.2.44@ AND include a @User-Agent@ header for which the value is @BadBot@ .

-- /See:/ 'rule' smart constructor.

-- | Creates a value of 'Rule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rMetricName' - A friendly name or description for the metrics for this @Rule@ . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change @MetricName@ after you create the @Rule@ .
--
-- * 'rName' - The friendly name or description for the @Rule@ . You can't change the name of a @Rule@ after you create it.
--
-- * 'rRuleId' - A unique identifier for a @Rule@ . You use @RuleId@ to get more information about a @Rule@ (see 'GetRule' ), update a @Rule@ (see 'UpdateRule' ), insert a @Rule@ into a @WebACL@ or delete a one from a @WebACL@ (see 'UpdateWebACL' ), or delete a @Rule@ from AWS WAF (see 'DeleteRule' ). @RuleId@ is returned by 'CreateRule' and by 'ListRules' .
--
-- * 'rPredicates' - The @Predicates@ object contains one @Predicate@ element for each 'ByteMatchSet' , 'IPSet' , or 'SqlInjectionMatchSet' object that you want to include in a @Rule@ .
