-- | Creates a value of 'ReplicationRun' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rrState' - The state of the replication run.
--
-- * 'rrReplicationRunId' - The ID of the replication run.
--
-- * 'rrEncrypted' - Indicates whether the replication run should produce an encrypted AMI.
--
-- * 'rrStageDetails' - Details about the current stage of the replication run.
--
-- * 'rrScheduledStartTime' - The start time of the next replication run.
--
-- * 'rrStatusMessage' - The description of the current status of the replication job.
--
-- * 'rrKmsKeyId' - The ID of the KMS key for replication jobs that produce encrypted AMIs. This value can be any of the following:     * KMS key ID     * KMS key alias     * ARN referring to the KMS key ID     * ARN referring to the KMS key alias If encrypted is /true/ but a KMS key ID is not specified, the customer's default KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. 
--
-- * 'rrCompletedTime' - The completion time of the last replication run.
--
-- * 'rrAmiId' - The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the replication run.
--
-- * 'rrType' - The type of replication run.
--
-- * 'rrDescription' - The description of the replication run.
