-- | Creates a value of 'OriginRequestPolicyCookiesConfig' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'orpccCookies' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'orpccCookieBehavior' - Determines whether cookies in viewer requests are included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:     * @none@ – Cookies in viewer requests are not included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to @none@ , any cookies that are listed in a @CachePolicy@ /are/ included in origin requests.     * @whitelist@ – The cookies in viewer requests that are listed in the @CookieNames@ type are included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.     * @all@ – All cookies in viewer requests are included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.
