-- | Creates a value of 'GeoRestriction' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'grItems' - A complex type that contains a @Location@ element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (@whitelist@ ) or not distribute your content (@blacklist@ ). The @Location@ element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your @blacklist@ or @whitelist@ . Include one @Location@ element for each country. CloudFront and @MaxMind@ both use @ISO 3166@ country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see @ISO 3166-1-alpha-2@ code on the /International Organization for Standardization/ website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.
--
-- * 'grRestrictionType' - The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:     * @none@ : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location.     * @blacklist@ : The @Location@ elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content.     * @whitelist@ : The @Location@ elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content.
--
-- * 'grQuantity' - When geo restriction is @enabled@ , this is the number of countries in your @whitelist@ or @blacklist@ . Otherwise, when it is not enabled, @Quantity@ is @0@ , and you can omit @Items@ .
