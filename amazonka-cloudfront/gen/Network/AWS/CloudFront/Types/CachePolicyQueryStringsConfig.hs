-- | Creates a value of 'CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cpqscQueryStrings' - Contains the specific query strings in viewer requests that either /__are__ / or /__are not__ / included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. The behavior depends on whether the @QueryStringBehavior@ field in the @CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig@ type is set to @whitelist@ (the listed query strings /__are__ / included) or @allExcept@ (the listed query strings /__are not__ / included, but all other query strings are).
--
-- * 'cpqscQueryStringBehavior' - Determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:     * @none@ – Query strings in viewer requests are not included in the cache key and are not automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to @none@ , any query strings that are listed in an @OriginRequestPolicy@ /are/ included in origin requests.     * @whitelist@ – The query strings in viewer requests that are listed in the @QueryStringNames@ type are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.     * @allExcept@ – All query strings in viewer requests that are /__not__ / listed in the @QueryStringNames@ type are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.     * @all@ – All query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.
