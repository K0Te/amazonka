-- | Creates a value of 'OriginRequestPolicyHeadersConfig' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'orphcHeaders' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'orphcHeaderBehavior' - Determines whether any HTTP headers are included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:     * @none@ – HTTP headers are not included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to @none@ , any headers that are listed in a @CachePolicy@ /are/ included in origin requests.     * @whitelist@ – The HTTP headers that are listed in the @Headers@ type are included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.     * @allViewer@ – All HTTP headers in viewer requests are included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.     * @allViewerAndWhitelistCloudFront@ – All HTTP headers in viewer requests and the additional CloudFront headers that are listed in the @Headers@ type are included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. The additional headers are added by CloudFront.
