-- | Creates a value of 'EncryptionEntity' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eePublicKeyId' - The public key associated with a set of field-level encryption patterns, to be used when encrypting the fields that match the patterns. 
--
-- * 'eeProviderId' - The provider associated with the public key being used for encryption. This value must also be provided with the private key for applications to be able to decrypt data.
--
-- * 'eeFieldPatterns' - Field patterns in a field-level encryption content type profile specify the fields that you want to be encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any beginning characters followed by a wildcard (*). You can't overlap field patterns. For example, you can't have both ABC* and AB*. Note that field patterns are case-sensitive.
