-- | An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When you create or update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin group instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the primary origin to the second origin under the failover conditions that you've chosen.
