-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fvQueryStringCacheKeys' - This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy Creating cache policies> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ . If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy Creating origin request policies> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ . A complex type that contains information about the query string parameters that you want CloudFront to use for caching for this cache behavior.
--
-- * 'fvHeaders' - This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. If you want to include headers in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy Creating cache policies> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ . If you want to send headers to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy Creating origin request policies> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ . A complex type that specifies the @Headers@ , if any, that you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior (whitelisted headers). For the headers that you specify, CloudFront also caches separate versions of a specified object that is based on the header values in viewer requests. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/header-caching.html Caching Content Based on Request Headers> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'fvQueryString' - This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy Creating cache policies> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ . If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy Creating origin request policies> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ . Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of @QueryString@ and on the values that you specify for @QueryStringCacheKeys@ , if any: If you specify true for @QueryString@ and you don't specify any values for @QueryStringCacheKeys@ , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin. If you specify true for @QueryString@ and you specify one or more values for @QueryStringCacheKeys@ , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify. If you specify false for @QueryString@ , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/QueryStringParameters.html Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'fvCookies' - This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy Creating cache policies> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ .
