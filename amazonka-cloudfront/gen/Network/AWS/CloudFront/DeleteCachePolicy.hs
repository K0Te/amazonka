-- Deletes a cache policy.
--
--
-- You cannot delete a cache policy if it’s attached to a cache behavior. First update your distributions to remove the cache policy from all cache behaviors, then delete the cache policy.
--
-- To delete a cache policy, you must provide the policy’s identifier and version. To get these values, you can use @ListCachePolicies@ or @GetCachePolicy@ .
