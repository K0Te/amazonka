-- | Creates a value of 'Environment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment.
--
-- * 'eLifecycle' - The state of the environment in its creation or deletion lifecycle.
--
-- * 'eOwnerARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment owner.
--
-- * 'eName' - The name of the environment.
--
-- * 'eId' - The ID of the environment.
--
-- * 'eType' - The type of environment. Valid values include the following:     * @ec2@ : An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance connects to the environment.     * @ssh@ : Your own server connects to the environment.
--
-- * 'eConnectionType' - The connection type used for connecting to an Amazon EC2 environment.
--
-- * 'eDescription' - The description for the environment.
