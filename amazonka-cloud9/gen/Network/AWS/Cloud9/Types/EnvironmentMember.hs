-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'emLastAccess' - The time, expressed in epoch time format, when the environment member last opened the environment.
--
-- * 'emUserId' - The user ID in AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) of the environment member.
--
-- * 'emUserARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment member.
