-- | Creates a value of 'QueryExecutionStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'qesState' - The state of query execution. @QUEUED@ indicates that the query has been submitted to the service, and Athena will execute the query as soon as resources are available. @RUNNING@ indicates that the query is in execution phase. @SUCCEEDED@ indicates that the query completed without errors. @FAILED@ indicates that the query experienced an error and did not complete processing. @CANCELLED@ indicates that a user input interrupted query execution.
--
-- * 'qesStateChangeReason' - Further detail about the status of the query.
--
-- * 'qesSubmissionDateTime' - The date and time that the query was submitted.
--
-- * 'qesCompletionDateTime' - The date and time that the query completed.
