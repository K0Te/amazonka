-- | Creates a value of 'QueryExecution' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'qeStatus' - The completion date, current state, submission time, and state change reason (if applicable) for the query execution.
--
-- * 'qeQueryExecutionContext' - The database in which the query execution occurred.
--
-- * 'qeResultConfiguration' - The location in Amazon S3 where query results were stored and the encryption option, if any, used for query results. These are known as "client-side settings". If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the location for the query results and the encryption configuration that are specified for the workgroup.
--
-- * 'qeQuery' - The SQL query statements which the query execution ran.
--
-- * 'qeStatementType' - The type of query statement that was run. @DDL@ indicates DDL query statements. @DML@ indicates DML (Data Manipulation Language) query statements, such as @CREATE TABLE AS SELECT@ . @UTILITY@ indicates query statements other than DDL and DML, such as @SHOW CREATE TABLE@ , or @DESCRIBE <table>@ .
--
-- * 'qeStatistics' - Query execution statistics, such as the amount of data scanned, the amount of time that the query took to process, and the type of statement that was run.
--
-- * 'qeQueryExecutionId' - The unique identifier for each query execution.
--
-- * 'qeWorkGroup' - The name of the workgroup in which the query ran.
