-- Creates an unreferenced commit that represents the result of merging two branches using a specified merge strategy. This can help you determine the outcome of a potential merge. This API cannot be used with the fast-forward merge strategy because that strategy does not create a merge commit.

-- | Creates a value of 'CreateUnreferencedMergeCommit' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cumcEmail' - The email address for the person who created the unreferenced commit.
--
-- * 'cumcAuthorName' - The name of the author who created the unreferenced commit. This information is used as both the author and committer for the commit.
--
-- * 'cumcConflictDetailLevel' - The level of conflict detail to use. If unspecified, the default FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a conflict is considered not mergeable if the same file in both branches has differences on the same line.
--
-- * 'cumcCommitMessage' - The commit message for the unreferenced commit.
--
-- * 'cumcConflictResolution' - If AUTOMERGE is the conflict resolution strategy, a list of inputs to use when resolving conflicts during a merge.
--
-- * 'cumcConflictResolutionStrategy' - Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before the merge operation is successful.
--
-- * 'cumcKeepEmptyFolders' - If the commit contains deletions, whether to keep a folder or folder structure if the changes leave the folders empty. If this is specified as true, a .gitkeep file is created for empty folders. The default is false.
--
-- * 'cumcRepositoryName' - The name of the repository where you want to create the unreferenced merge commit.
--
-- * 'cumcSourceCommitSpecifier' - The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).
--
-- * 'cumcDestinationCommitSpecifier' - The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).
--
-- * 'cumcMergeOption' - The merge option or strategy you want to use to merge the code.
