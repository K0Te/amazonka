-- | Creates a value of 'GetMergeCommit' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gmcConflictDetailLevel' - The level of conflict detail to use. If unspecified, the default FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a conflict is considered not mergeable if the same file in both branches has differences on the same line.
--
-- * 'gmcConflictResolutionStrategy' - Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before the merge operation is successful.
--
-- * 'gmcRepositoryName' - The name of the repository that contains the merge commit about which you want to get information.
--
-- * 'gmcSourceCommitSpecifier' - The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).
--
-- * 'gmcDestinationCommitSpecifier' - The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).
