-- | Creates a value of 'MergeHunk' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mhDestination' - Information about the merge hunk in the destination of a merge or pull request.
--
-- * 'mhBase' - Information about the merge hunk in the base of a merge or pull request.
--
-- * 'mhIsConflict' - A Boolean value indicating whether a combination of hunks contains a conflict. Conflicts occur when the same file or the same lines in a file were modified in both the source and destination of a merge or pull request. Valid values include true, false, and null. True when the hunk represents a conflict and one or more files contains a line conflict. File mode conflicts in a merge do not set this to true.
--
-- * 'mhSource' - Information about the merge hunk in the source of a merge or pull request.
