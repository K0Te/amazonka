-- | Creates a value of 'ConflictMetadata' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cmNumberOfConflicts' - The number of conflicts, including both hunk conflicts and metadata conflicts.
--
-- * 'cmContentConflict' - A boolean value indicating whether there are conflicts in the content of a file.
--
-- * 'cmFileSizes' - The file sizes of the file in the source, destination, and base of the merge.
--
-- * 'cmFilePath' - The path of the file that contains conflicts.
--
-- * 'cmIsBinaryFile' - A boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the file is binary or textual in the source, destination, and base of the merge.
--
-- * 'cmFileModeConflict' - A boolean value indicating whether there are conflicts in the file mode of a file.
--
-- * 'cmObjectTypeConflict' - A boolean value (true or false) indicating whether there are conflicts between the branches in the object type of a file, folder, or submodule.
--
-- * 'cmMergeOperations' - Whether an add, modify, or delete operation caused the conflict between the source and destination of the merge.
--
-- * 'cmObjectTypes' - Information about any object type conflicts in a merge operation.
--
-- * 'cmFileModes' - The file modes of the file in the source, destination, and base of the merge.
