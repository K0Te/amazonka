-- | Creates a value of 'Comment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cLastModifiedDate' - The date and time the comment was most recently modified, in timestamp format.
--
-- * 'cAuthorARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the person who posted the comment.
--
-- * 'cContent' - The content of the comment.
--
-- * 'cCallerReactions' - The emoji reactions to a comment, if any, submitted by the user whose credentials are associated with the call to the API.
--
-- * 'cCreationDate' - The date and time the comment was created, in timestamp format.
--
-- * 'cDeleted' - A Boolean value indicating whether the comment has been deleted.
--
-- * 'cClientRequestToken' - A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided in a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed parameter. If a request is received with the same parameters and a token is included, the request returns information about the initial request that used that token.
--
-- * 'cCommentId' - The system-generated comment ID.
--
-- * 'cInReplyTo' - The ID of the comment for which this comment is a reply, if any.
--
-- * 'cReactionCounts' - A string to integer map that represents the number of individual users who have responded to a comment with the specified reactions.
