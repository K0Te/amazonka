-- | Creates a value of 'ReactionForComment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rfcReactionUsers' - The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of users who have provided reactions to the comment.
--
-- * 'rfcReactionsFromDeletedUsersCount' - A numerical count of users who reacted with the specified emoji whose identities have been subsequently deleted from IAM. While these IAM users or roles no longer exist, the reactions might still appear in total reaction counts.
