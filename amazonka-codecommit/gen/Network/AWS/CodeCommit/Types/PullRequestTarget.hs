-- | Creates a value of 'PullRequestTarget' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'prtSourceCommit' - The full commit ID of the tip of the source branch used to create the pull request. If the pull request branch is updated by a push while the pull request is open, the commit ID changes to reflect the new tip of the branch.
--
-- * 'prtDestinationReference' - The branch of the repository where the pull request changes are merged. Also known as the destination branch. 
--
-- * 'prtMergeMetadata' - Returns metadata about the state of the merge, including whether the merge has been made.
--
-- * 'prtMergeBase' - The commit ID of the most recent commit that the source branch and the destination branch have in common.
--
-- * 'prtDestinationCommit' - The full commit ID that is the tip of the destination branch. This is the commit where the pull request was or will be merged.
--
-- * 'prtRepositoryName' - The name of the repository that contains the pull request source and destination branches.
--
-- * 'prtSourceReference' - The branch of the repository that contains the changes for the pull request. Also known as the source branch.
