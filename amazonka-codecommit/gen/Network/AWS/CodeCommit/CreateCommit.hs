--
-- * 'ccEmail' - The email address of the person who created the commit.
--
-- * 'ccAuthorName' - The name of the author who created the commit. This information is used as both the author and committer for the commit.
--

--
-- * 'ccDeleteFiles' - The files to delete in this commit. These files still exist in earlier commits.
--
-- * 'ccPutFiles' - The files to add or update in this commit.
--
-- * 'ccCommitMessage' - The commit message you want to include in the commit. Commit messages are limited to 256 KB. If no message is specified, a default message is used.
--
-- * 'ccKeepEmptyFolders' - If the commit contains deletions, whether to keep a folder or folder structure if the changes leave the folders empty. If true, a ..gitkeep file is created for empty folders. The default is false.
