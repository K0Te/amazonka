-- | Creates a value of 'OrganizationEvent' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'oeLastUpdatedTime' - The most recent date and time that the event was updated.
--
-- * 'oeArn' - The unique identifier for the event. Format: @arn:aws:health:/event-region/ ::event//SERVICE/ //EVENT_TYPE_CODE/ //EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID/ @ . Example: @Example: arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456@ 
--
-- * 'oeService' - The AWS service that is affected by the event. For example, EC2, RDS.
--
-- * 'oeStartTime' - The date and time that the event began.
--
-- * 'oeEventScopeCode' - This parameter specifies if the AWS Health event is a public AWS service event or an account-specific event.     * If the @eventScopeCode@ value is @PUBLIC@ , then the @affectedAccounts@ value is always empty.     * If the @eventScopeCode@ value is @ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC@ , then the @affectedAccounts@ value lists the affected AWS accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have AWS accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in the response.     * If the @eventScopeCode@ value is @NONE@ , then the @eventArn@ that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.
--
-- * 'oeEventTypeCode' - The unique identifier for the event type. The format is @AWS_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION@ . For example, @AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT@ .
--
-- * 'oeEventTypeCategory' - The category of the event type.
--
-- * 'oeEndTime' - The date and time that the event ended.
--
-- * 'oeRegion' - The AWS Region name of the event.
--
-- * 'oeStatusCode' - The most recent status of the event. Possible values are @open@ , @closed@ , and @upcoming@ .
