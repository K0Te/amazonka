-- Returns a list of entities that have been affected by one or more events for one or more accounts in your organization in AWS Organizations, based on the filter criteria. Entities can refer to individual customer resources, groups of customer resources, or any other construct, depending on the AWS service.
--
--
-- At least one event Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and account ID are required. Results are sorted by the @lastUpdatedTime@ of the entity, starting with the most recent.
--
-- Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization> operation from your organization's master account. 
--
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
