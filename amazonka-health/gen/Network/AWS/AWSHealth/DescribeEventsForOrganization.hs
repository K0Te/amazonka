-- Returns information about events across your organization in AWS Organizations. You can use the@filters@ parameter to specify the events that you want to return. Events are returned in a summary form and don't include the affected accounts, detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the following operations:
--
--
--     * <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization.html DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization> 
--
--     * <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization.html DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization> 
--
--     * <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization.html DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization> 
--
--
--
-- If you don't specify a @filter@ , the @DescribeEventsForOrganizations@ returns all events across your organization. Results are sorted by @lastModifiedTime@ , starting with the most recent event. 
--
-- For more information about the different types of AWS Health events, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html Event> .
--
-- Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization> operation from your organization's master AWS account.
--
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
