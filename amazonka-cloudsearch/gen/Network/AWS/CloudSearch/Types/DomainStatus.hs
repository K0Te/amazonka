-- | Creates a value of 'DomainStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dsSearchInstanceCount' - The number of search instances that are available to process search requests.
--
-- * 'dsSearchInstanceType' - The instance type that is being used to process search requests.
--
-- * 'dsDocService' - The service endpoint for updating documents in a search domain.
--
-- * 'dsARN' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'dsCreated' - True if the search domain is created. It can take several minutes to initialize a domain when 'CreateDomain' is called. Newly created search domains are returned from 'DescribeDomains' with a false value for Created until domain creation is complete.
--
-- * 'dsSearchService' - The service endpoint for requesting search results from a search domain.
--
-- * 'dsLimits' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'dsSearchPartitionCount' - The number of partitions across which the search index is spread.
--
-- * 'dsDeleted' - True if the search domain has been deleted. The system must clean up resources dedicated to the search domain when 'DeleteDomain' is called. Newly deleted search domains are returned from 'DescribeDomains' with a true value for IsDeleted for several minutes until resource cleanup is complete.
--
-- * 'dsProcessing' - True if processing is being done to activate the current domain configuration.
--
-- * 'dsDomainId' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'dsDomainName' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'dsRequiresIndexDocuments' - True if 'IndexDocuments' needs to be called to activate the current domain configuration.
