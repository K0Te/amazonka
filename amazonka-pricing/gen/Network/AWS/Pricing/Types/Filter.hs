-- | Creates a value of 'Filter' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fType' - The type of filter that you want to use. Valid values are: @TERM_MATCH@ . @TERM_MATCH@ returns only products that match both the given filter field and the given value.
--
-- * 'fField' - The product metadata field that you want to filter on. You can filter by just the service code to see all products for a specific service, filter by just the attribute name to see a specific attribute for multiple services, or use both a service code and an attribute name to retrieve only products that match both fields. Valid values include: @ServiceCode@ , and all attribute names For example, you can filter by the @AmazonEC2@ service code and the @volumeType@ attribute name to get the prices for only Amazon EC2 volumes.
--
-- * 'fValue' - The service code or attribute value that you want to filter by. If you are filtering by service code this is the actual service code, such as @AmazonEC2@ . If you are filtering by attribute name, this is the attribute value that you want the returned products to match, such as a @Provisioned IOPS@ volume.
