-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jesStatus' - The status of the job execution. Can be one of: "QUEUED", "IN_PROGRESS", "FAILED", "SUCCESS", "CANCELED", "REJECTED", or "REMOVED".
--
-- * 'jesStatusDetails' - A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job execution.
--
-- * 'jesVersionNumber' - The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are incremented each time they are updated by a device.
