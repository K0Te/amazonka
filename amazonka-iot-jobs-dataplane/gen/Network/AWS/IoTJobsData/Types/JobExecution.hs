-- | Creates a value of 'JobExecution' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jeStatus' - The status of the job execution. Can be one of: "QUEUED", "IN_PROGRESS", "FAILED", "SUCCESS", "CANCELED", "REJECTED", or "REMOVED".
--
-- * 'jeJobId' - The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.
--
-- * 'jeLastUpdatedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was last updated. 
--
-- * 'jeApproximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut' - The estimated number of seconds that remain before the job execution status will be changed to @TIMED_OUT@ .
--
-- * 'jeQueuedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was enqueued.
--
-- * 'jeJobDocument' - The content of the job document.
--
-- * 'jeStatusDetails' - A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job execution.
--
-- * 'jeExecutionNumber' - A number that identifies a particular job execution on a particular device. It can be used later in commands that return or update job execution information.
--
-- * 'jeVersionNumber' - The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are incremented each time they are updated by a device.
--
-- * 'jeStartedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was started.
--
-- * 'jeThingName' - The name of the thing that is executing the job.
