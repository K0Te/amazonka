-- | Creates a value of 'JobExecutionSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jJobId' - The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.
--
-- * 'jLastUpdatedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was last updated.
--
-- * 'jQueuedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was enqueued.
--
-- * 'jExecutionNumber' - A number that identifies a particular job execution on a particular device.
--
-- * 'jVersionNumber' - The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are incremented each time AWS IoT Jobs receives an update from a device.
--
-- * 'jStartedAt' - The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution started.
