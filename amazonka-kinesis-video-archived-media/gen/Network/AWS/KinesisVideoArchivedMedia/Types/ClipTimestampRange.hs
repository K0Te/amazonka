-- | Creates a value of 'ClipTimestampRange' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ctrStartTimestamp' - The starting timestamp in the range of timestamps for which to return fragments.  This value is inclusive. Fragments that start before the @StartTimestamp@ and continue past it are included in the session. If @FragmentSelectorType@ is @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@ , the @StartTimestamp@ must be later than the stream head. 
--
-- * 'ctrEndTimestamp' - The end of the timestamp range for the requested media. This value must be within 3 hours of the specified @StartTimestamp@ , and it must be later than the @StartTimestamp@ value. If @FragmentSelectorType@ for the request is @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@ , this value must be in the past.  This value is inclusive. The @EndTimestamp@ is compared to the (starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the @EndTimestamp@ value and continue past it are included in the session.
