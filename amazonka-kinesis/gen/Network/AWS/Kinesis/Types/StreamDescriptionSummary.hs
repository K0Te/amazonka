-- | Creates a value of 'StreamDescriptionSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sdsEncryptionType' - The encryption type used. This value is one of the following:     * @KMS@      * @NONE@ 
--
-- * 'sdsKeyId' - The GUID for the customer-managed AWS KMS key to use for encryption. This value can be a globally unique identifier, a fully specified ARN to either an alias or a key, or an alias name prefixed by "alias/".You can also use a master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias @aws/kinesis@ .     * Key ARN example: @arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012@      * Alias ARN example: @arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName@      * Globally unique key ID example: @12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012@      * Alias name example: @alias/MyAliasName@      * Master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams: @alias/aws/kinesis@ 
--
-- * 'sdsConsumerCount' - The number of enhanced fan-out consumers registered with the stream.
--
-- * 'sdsStreamName' - The name of the stream being described.
--
-- * 'sdsStreamARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream being described.
--
-- * 'sdsStreamStatus' - The current status of the stream being described. The stream status is one of the following states:     * @CREATING@ - The stream is being created. Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets @StreamStatus@ to @CREATING@ .     * @DELETING@ - The stream is being deleted. The specified stream is in the @DELETING@ state until Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion.     * @ACTIVE@ - The stream exists and is ready for read and write operations or deletion. You should perform read and write operations only on an @ACTIVE@ stream.     * @UPDATING@ - Shards in the stream are being merged or split. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the @UPDATING@ state.
--
-- * 'sdsRetentionPeriodHours' - The current retention period, in hours.
--
-- * 'sdsStreamCreationTimestamp' - The approximate time that the stream was created.
--
-- * 'sdsEnhancedMonitoring' - Represents the current enhanced monitoring settings of the stream.
--
-- * 'sdsOpenShardCount' - The number of open shards in the stream.
