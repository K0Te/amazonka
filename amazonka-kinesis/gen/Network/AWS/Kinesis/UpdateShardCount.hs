-- Updates the shard count of the specified stream to the specified number of shards.
--
--
-- Updating the shard count is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to @UPDATING@ . After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to @ACTIVE@ . Depending on the size of the stream, the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is @UPDATING@ .
--
-- To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on individual shards. This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition to the final shards. These short-lived shards count towards your total shard limit for your account in the Region.
--
-- When using this operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard count that is a multiple of 25% (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). You can specify any target value within your shard limit. However, if you specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling action might take longer to complete. 
--
-- This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do the following:
--
--     * Scale more than ten times per rolling 24-hour period per stream
--
--     * Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream
--
--     * Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream
--
--     * Scale up to more than 500 shards in a stream
--
--     * Scale a stream with more than 500 shards down unless the result is less than 500 shards
--
--     * Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account
--
--
--
-- For the default limits for an AWS account, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html Streams Limits> in the /Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide/ . To request an increase in the call rate limit, the shard limit for this API, or your overall shard limit, use the <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/v1#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-kinesis limits form> .
