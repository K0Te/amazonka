-- | A JSON-formatted object that contains the metadata for a support case. It is contained in the response from a 'DescribeCases' request. __CaseDetails__ contains the following fields:
--
--
--     * __caseId.__ The AWS Support case ID requested or returned in the call. The case ID is an alphanumeric string formatted as shown in this example: case-/12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47/ .
--
--     * __categoryCode.__ The category of problem for the AWS Support case. Corresponds to the CategoryCode values returned by a call to 'DescribeServices' .
--
--     * __displayId.__ The identifier for the case on pages in the AWS Support Center.
--
--     * __language.__ The ISO 639-1 code for the language in which AWS provides support. AWS Support currently supports English ("en") and Japanese ("ja"). Language parameters must be passed explicitly for operations that take them.
--
--     * __nextToken.__ A resumption point for pagination.
--
--     * __recentCommunications.__ One or more 'Communication' objects. Fields of these objects are @attachments@ , @body@ , @caseId@ , @submittedBy@ , and @timeCreated@ .
--
--     * __serviceCode.__ The identifier for the AWS service that corresponds to the service code defined in the call to 'DescribeServices' .
--
--     * __severityCode.__ The severity code assigned to the case. Contains one of the values returned by the call to 'DescribeSeverityLevels' . The possible values are: @low@ , @normal@ , @high@ , @urgent@ , and @critical@ .
--
--     * __status.__ The status of the case in the AWS Support Center. Valid values:
--
--     * @opened@ 
--
--     * @pending-customer-action@ 
--
--     * @reopened@ 
--
--     * @resolved@ 
--
--     * @unassigned@ 
--
