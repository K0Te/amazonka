-- | Creates a value of 'TrustedAdvisorResourceDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tardIsSuppressed' - Specifies whether the AWS resource was ignored by Trusted Advisor because it was marked as suppressed by the user.
--
-- * 'tardRegion' - The AWS region in which the identified resource is located.
--
-- * 'tardStatus' - The status code for the resource identified in the Trusted Advisor check.
--
-- * 'tardResourceId' - The unique identifier for the identified resource.
--
-- * 'tardMetadata' - Additional information about the identified resource. The exact metadata and its order can be obtained by inspecting the 'TrustedAdvisorCheckDescription' object returned by the call to 'DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks' . __Metadata__ contains all the data that is shown in the Excel download, even in those cases where the UI shows just summary data.
