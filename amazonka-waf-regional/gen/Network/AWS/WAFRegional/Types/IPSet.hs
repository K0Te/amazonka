-- | Contains one or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses specified in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. AWS WAF supports IPv4 address ranges: /8 and any range between /16 through /32. AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, and /128.
--
--
-- To specify an individual IP address, you specify the four-part IP address followed by a @/32@ , for example, 192.0.2.0/32. To block a range of IP addresses, you can specify /8 or any range between /16 through /32 (for IPv4) or /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, or /128 (for IPv6). For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing Classless Inter-Domain Routing> .

-- | Creates a value of 'IPSet' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'isName' - A friendly name or description of the 'IPSet' . You can't change the name of an @IPSet@ after you create it.
--
-- * 'isIPSetId' - The @IPSetId@ for an @IPSet@ . You use @IPSetId@ to get information about an @IPSet@ (see 'GetIPSet' ), update an @IPSet@ (see 'UpdateIPSet' ), insert an @IPSet@ into a @Rule@ or delete one from a @Rule@ (see 'UpdateRule' ), and delete an @IPSet@ from AWS WAF (see 'DeleteIPSet' ). @IPSetId@ is returned by 'CreateIPSet' and by 'ListIPSets' .
--
-- * 'isIPSetDescriptors' - The IP address type (@IPV4@ or @IPV6@ ) and the IP address range (in CIDR notation) that web requests originate from. If the @WebACL@ is associated with a CloudFront distribution and the viewer did not use an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, this is the value of the c-ip field in the CloudFront access logs.
