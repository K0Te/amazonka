-- | A @RateBasedRule@ is identical to a regular 'Rule' , with one addition: a @RateBasedRule@ counts the number of requests that arrive from a specified IP address every five minutes. For example, based on recent requests that you've seen from an attacker, you might create a @RateBasedRule@ that includes the following conditions: 
--
--
--     * The requests come from 192.0.2.44.
--
--     * They contain the value @BadBot@ in the @User-Agent@ header.
--
--
--
-- In the rule, you also define the rate limit as 1,000.
--
-- Requests that meet both of these conditions and exceed 1,000 requests every five minutes trigger the rule's action (block or count), which is defined in the web ACL.

-- | Creates a value of 'RateBasedRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rbrMetricName' - A friendly name or description for the metrics for a @RateBasedRule@ . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric after you create the @RateBasedRule@ .
--
-- * 'rbrName' - A friendly name or description for a @RateBasedRule@ . You can't change the name of a @RateBasedRule@ after you create it.
--
-- * 'rbrRuleId' - A unique identifier for a @RateBasedRule@ . You use @RuleId@ to get more information about a @RateBasedRule@ (see 'GetRateBasedRule' ), update a @RateBasedRule@ (see 'UpdateRateBasedRule' ), insert a @RateBasedRule@ into a @WebACL@ or delete one from a @WebACL@ (see 'UpdateWebACL' ), or delete a @RateBasedRule@ from AWS WAF (see 'DeleteRateBasedRule' ).
--
-- * 'rbrMatchPredicates' - The @Predicates@ object contains one @Predicate@ element for each 'ByteMatchSet' , 'IPSet' , or 'SqlInjectionMatchSet' object that you want to include in a @RateBasedRule@ .
--
-- * 'rbrRateKey' - The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring. The only valid value for @RateKey@ is @IP@ . @IP@ indicates that requests arriving from the same IP address are subject to the @RateLimit@ that is specified in the @RateBasedRule@ .
--
-- * 'rbrRateLimit' - The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the field specified by the @RateKey@ , allowed in a five-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the @RateLimit@ and the other predicates specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the action that is specified for this rule.
