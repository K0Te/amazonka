module Network.AWS.AutoScaling.Types.LoadBalancerTargetGroupState where

import Network.AWS.Lens
import Network.AWS.Prelude

-- | Describes the state of a target group.
--
--
-- If you attach a target group to an existing Auto Scaling group, the initial state is @Adding@ . The state transitions to @Added@ after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the target group. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled, the state transitions to @InService@ after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. If EC2 health checks are enabled instead, the target group remains in the @Added@ state.

-- | Creates a value of 'LoadBalancerTargetGroupState' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lbtgsState' - The state of the target group.     * @Adding@ - The Auto Scaling instances are being registered with the target group.     * @Added@ - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with the target group.     * @InService@ - At least one Auto Scaling instance passed an ELB health check.     * @Removing@ - The Auto Scaling instances are being deregistered from the target group. If connection draining is enabled, Elastic Load Balancing waits for in-flight requests to complete before deregistering the instances.     * @Removed@ - All Auto Scaling instances are deregistered from the target group.
--
-- * 'lbtgsLoadBalancerTargetGroupARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.
