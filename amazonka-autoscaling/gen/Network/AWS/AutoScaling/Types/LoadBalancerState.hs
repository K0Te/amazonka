module Network.AWS.AutoScaling.Types.LoadBalancerState where

import Network.AWS.Lens
import Network.AWS.Prelude

-- | Describes the state of a Classic Load Balancer.
--
--
-- If you specify a load balancer when creating the Auto Scaling group, the state of the load balancer is @InService@ .
--
-- If you attach a load balancer to an existing Auto Scaling group, the initial state is @Adding@ . The state transitions to @Added@ after all instances in the group are registered with the load balancer. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the load balancer, the state transitions to @InService@ after at least one instance in the group passes the health check. If EC2 health checks are enabled instead, the load balancer remains in the @Added@ state.

-- | Creates a value of 'LoadBalancerState' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lbsState' - One of the following load balancer states:     * @Adding@ - The instances in the group are being registered with the load balancer.     * @Added@ - All instances in the group are registered with the load balancer.     * @InService@ - At least one instance in the group passed an ELB health check.     * @Removing@ - The instances in the group are being deregistered from the load balancer. If connection draining is enabled, Elastic Load Balancing waits for in-flight requests to complete before deregistering the instances.     * @Removed@ - All instances in the group are deregistered from the load balancer.
--
-- * 'lbsLoadBalancerName' - The name of the load balancer.
