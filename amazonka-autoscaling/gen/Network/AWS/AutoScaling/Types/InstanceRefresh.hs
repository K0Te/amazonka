-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceRefresh' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'irStatus' - The current status for the instance refresh operation:     * @Pending@ - The request was created, but the operation has not started.     * @InProgress@ - The operation is in progress.     * @Successful@ - The operation completed successfully.     * @Failed@ - The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot using the status reason and the scaling activities.      * @Cancelling@ - An ongoing operation is being cancelled. Cancellation does not roll back any replacements that have already been completed, but it prevents new replacements from being started.      * @Cancelled@ - The operation is cancelled. 
--
-- * 'irStartTime' - The date and time at which the instance refresh began.
--
-- * 'irInstancesToUpdate' - The number of instances remaining to update before the instance refresh is complete.
--
-- * 'irPercentageComplete' - The percentage of the instance refresh that is complete. For each instance replacement, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tracks the instance's health status and warm-up time. When the instance's health status changes to healthy and the specified warm-up time passes, the instance is considered updated and added to the percentage complete.
--
-- * 'irAutoScalingGroupName' - The name of the Auto Scaling group.
--
-- * 'irEndTime' - The date and time at which the instance refresh ended.
--
-- * 'irStatusReason' - Provides more details about the current status of the instance refresh. 
--
-- * 'irInstanceRefreshId' - The instance refresh ID.
