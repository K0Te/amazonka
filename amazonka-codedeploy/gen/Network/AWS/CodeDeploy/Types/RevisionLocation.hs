-- * 'rlString' - Information about the location of an AWS Lambda deployment revision stored as a RawString.
--
-- * 'rlRevisionType' - The type of application revision:     * S3: An application revision stored in Amazon S3.     * GitHub: An application revision stored in GitHub (EC2/On-premises deployments only).     * String: A YAML-formatted or JSON-formatted string (AWS Lambda deployments only).     * AppSpecContent: An @AppSpecContent@ object that contains the contents of an AppSpec file for an AWS Lambda or Amazon ECS deployment. The content is formatted as JSON or YAML stored as a RawString.
--
-- * 'rlS3Location' - Information about the location of a revision stored in Amazon S3.
