-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dtInstanceTarget' - Information about the target for a deployment that uses the EC2/On-premises compute platform. 
--
-- * 'dtCloudFormationTarget' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'dtEcsTarget' - Information about the target for a deployment that uses the Amazon ECS compute platform. 
--
-- * 'dtDeploymentTargetType' - The deployment type that is specific to the deployment's compute platform or deployments initiated by a CloudFormation stack update.
--
-- * 'dtLambdaTarget' - Information about the target for a deployment that uses the AWS Lambda compute platform.
