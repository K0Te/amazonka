-- | Creates a value of 'TargetGroupPairInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tgpiProdTrafficRoute' - The path used by a load balancer to route production traffic when an Amazon ECS deployment is complete. 
--
-- * 'tgpiTestTrafficRoute' - An optional path used by a load balancer to route test traffic after an Amazon ECS deployment. Validation can occur while test traffic is served during a deployment. 
--
-- * 'tgpiTargetGroups' - One pair of target groups. One is associated with the original task set. The second is associated with the task set that serves traffic after the deployment is complete.
