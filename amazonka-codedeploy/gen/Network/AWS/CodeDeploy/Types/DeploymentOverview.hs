-- | Creates a value of 'DeploymentOverview' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'doPending' - The number of instances in the deployment in a pending state.
--
-- * 'doSkipped' - The number of instances in the deployment in a skipped state.
--
-- * 'doInProgress' - The number of instances in which the deployment is in progress.
--
-- * 'doSucceeded' - The number of instances in the deployment to which revisions have been successfully deployed.
--
-- * 'doReady' - The number of instances in a replacement environment ready to receive traffic in a blue/green deployment.
--
-- * 'doFailed' - The number of instances in the deployment in a failed state.
