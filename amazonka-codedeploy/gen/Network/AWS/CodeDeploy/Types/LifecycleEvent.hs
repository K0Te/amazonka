-- | Creates a value of 'LifecycleEvent' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'leStatus' - The deployment lifecycle event status:     * Pending: The deployment lifecycle event is pending.     * InProgress: The deployment lifecycle event is in progress.     * Succeeded: The deployment lifecycle event ran successfully.     * Failed: The deployment lifecycle event has failed.     * Skipped: The deployment lifecycle event has been skipped.     * Unknown: The deployment lifecycle event is unknown.
--
-- * 'leLifecycleEventName' - The deployment lifecycle event name, such as @ApplicationStop@ , @BeforeInstall@ , @AfterInstall@ , @ApplicationStart@ , or @ValidateService@ .
--
-- * 'leStartTime' - A timestamp that indicates when the deployment lifecycle event started.
--
-- * 'leDiagnostics' - Diagnostic information about the deployment lifecycle event.
--
-- * 'leEndTime' - A timestamp that indicates when the deployment lifecycle event ended.
