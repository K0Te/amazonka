-- | Creates a value of 'TrafficRoutingConfig' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'trcTimeBasedCanary' - A configuration that shifts traffic from one version of a Lambda function or ECS task set to another in two increments. The original and target Lambda function versions or ECS task sets are specified in the deployment's AppSpec file.
--
-- * 'trcTimeBasedLinear' - A configuration that shifts traffic from one version of a Lambda function or ECS task set to another in equal increments, with an equal number of minutes between each increment. The original and target Lambda function versions or ECS task sets are specified in the deployment's AppSpec file.
--
-- * 'trcType' - The type of traffic shifting (@TimeBasedCanary@ or @TimeBasedLinear@ ) used by a deployment configuration.
