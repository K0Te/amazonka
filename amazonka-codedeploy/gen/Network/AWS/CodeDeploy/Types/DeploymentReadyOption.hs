-- | Creates a value of 'DeploymentReadyOption' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'droActionOnTimeout' - Information about when to reroute traffic from an original environment to a replacement environment in a blue/green deployment.     * CONTINUE_DEPLOYMENT: Register new instances with the load balancer immediately after the new application revision is installed on the instances in the replacement environment.     * STOP_DEPLOYMENT: Do not register new instances with a load balancer unless traffic rerouting is started using 'ContinueDeployment' . If traffic rerouting is not started before the end of the specified wait period, the deployment status is changed to Stopped.
--
-- * 'droWaitTimeInMinutes' - The number of minutes to wait before the status of a blue/green deployment is changed to Stopped if rerouting is not started manually. Applies only to the @STOP_DEPLOYMENT@ option for @actionOnTimeout@ .
