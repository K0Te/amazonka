-- | Creates a value of 'MinimumHealthyHosts' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mhhValue' - The minimum healthy instance value.
--
-- * 'mhhType' - The minimum healthy instance type:     * @HOST_COUNT@ : The minimum number of healthy instances as an absolute value.     * @FLEET_PERCENT@ : The minimum number of healthy instances as a percentage of the total number of instances in the deployment. In an example of nine instances, if a HOST_COUNT of six is specified, deploy to up to three instances at a time. The deployment is successful if six or more instances are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to up to five instances at a time. The deployment is successful if four or more instances are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/instances-health.html AWS CodeDeploy Instance Health> in the /AWS CodeDeploy User Guide/ .
