-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:

-- * 'eiCode' - For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/error-codes.html Error Codes for AWS CodeDeploy> in the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide AWS CodeDeploy User Guide> . The error code:     * APPLICATION_MISSING: The application was missing. This error code is most likely raised if the application is deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is started.     * DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_MISSING: The deployment group was missing. This error code is most likely raised if the deployment group is deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is started.     * HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS: The deployment failed on too many instances to be successfully deployed within the instance health constraints specified.     * HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS_INVALID: The revision cannot be successfully deployed within the instance health constraints specified.     * IAM_ROLE_MISSING: The service role cannot be accessed.     * IAM_ROLE_PERMISSIONS: The service role does not have the correct permissions.     * INTERNAL_ERROR: There was an internal error.     * NO_EC2_SUBSCRIPTION: The calling account is not subscribed to Amazon EC2.     * NO_INSTANCES: No instances were specified, or no instances can be found.     * OVER_MAX_INSTANCES: The maximum number of instances was exceeded.     * THROTTLED: The operation was throttled because the calling account exceeded the throttling limits of one or more AWS services.     * TIMEOUT: The deployment has timed out.     * REVISION_MISSING: The revision ID was missing. This error code is most likely raised if the revision is deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is started.
--
-- * 'eiMessage' - An accompanying error message.
