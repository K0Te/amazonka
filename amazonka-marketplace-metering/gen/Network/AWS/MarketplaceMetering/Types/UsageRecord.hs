-- | Creates a value of 'UsageRecord' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'urQuantity' - The quantity of usage consumed by the customer for the given dimension and time. Defaults to @0@ if not specified.
--
-- * 'urUsageAllocations' - The set of UsageAllocations to submit. The sum of all UsageAllocation quantities must equal the Quantity of the UsageRecord.
--
-- * 'urTimestamp' - Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported. Your application can meter usage for up to one hour in the past. Make sure the timestamp value is not before the start of the software usage.
--
-- * 'urCustomerIdentifier' - The CustomerIdentifier is obtained through the ResolveCustomer operation and represents an individual buyer in your application.
--
-- * 'urDimension' - During the process of registering a product on AWS Marketplace, up to eight dimensions are specified. These represent different units of value in your application.
