-- | Creates a value of 'UsageRecordResult' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'urrStatus' - The UsageRecordResult Status indicates the status of an individual UsageRecord processed by BatchMeterUsage.     * /Success/ - The UsageRecord was accepted and honored by BatchMeterUsage.     * /CustomerNotSubscribed/ - The CustomerIdentifier specified is not subscribed to your product. The UsageRecord was not honored. Future UsageRecords for this customer will fail until the customer subscribes to your product.     * /DuplicateRecord/ - Indicates that the UsageRecord was invalid and not honored. A previously metered UsageRecord had the same customer, dimension, and time, but a different quantity.
--
-- * 'urrUsageRecord' - The UsageRecord that was part of the BatchMeterUsage request.
--
-- * 'urrMeteringRecordId' - The MeteringRecordId is a unique identifier for this metering event.
