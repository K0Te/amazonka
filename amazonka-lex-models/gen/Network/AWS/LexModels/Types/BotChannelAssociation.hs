-- | Creates a value of 'BotChannelAssociation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bcaFailureReason' - If @status@ is @FAILED@ , Amazon Lex provides the reason that it failed to create the association.
--
-- * 'bcaStatus' - The status of the bot channel.      * @CREATED@ - The channel has been created and is ready for use.     * @IN_PROGRESS@ - Channel creation is in progress.     * @FAILED@ - There was an error creating the channel. For information about the reason for the failure, see the @failureReason@ field.
--
-- * 'bcaBotAlias' - An alias pointing to the specific version of the Amazon Lex bot to which this association is being made. 
--
-- * 'bcaBotName' - The name of the Amazon Lex bot to which this association is being made. 
--
-- * 'bcaBotConfiguration' - Provides information necessary to communicate with the messaging platform. 
--
-- * 'bcaCreatedDate' - The date that the association between the Amazon Lex bot and the channel was created. 
--
-- * 'bcaName' - The name of the association between the bot and the channel. 
--
-- * 'bcaType' - Specifies the type of association by indicating the type of channel being established between the Amazon Lex bot and the external messaging platform.
--
-- * 'bcaDescription' - A text description of the association you are creating.
