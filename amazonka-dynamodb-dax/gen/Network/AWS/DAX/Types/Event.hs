-- | Creates a value of 'Event' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eSourceName' - The source of the event. For example, if the event occurred at the node level, the source would be the node ID.
--
-- * 'eSourceType' - Specifies the origin of this event - a cluster, a parameter group, a node ID, etc.
--
-- * 'eDate' - The date and time when the event occurred.
--
-- * 'eMessage' - A user-defined message associated with the event.
