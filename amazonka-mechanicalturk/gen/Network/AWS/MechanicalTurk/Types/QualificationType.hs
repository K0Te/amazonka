The type also describes how a Worker can obtain a Qualification of that type, such as through a Qualification test.

-- | Creates a value of 'QualificationType' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'qtCreationTime' - The date and time the Qualification type was created. 
--
-- * 'qtTestDurationInSeconds' - The amount of time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete the Qualification test, beginning from the time the Worker requests the Qualification. 
--
-- * 'qtQualificationTypeStatus' - The status of the Qualification type. A Qualification type's status determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive. 
--
-- * 'qtAnswerKey' - The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test parameter.
--
-- * 'qtTest' - The questions for a Qualification test associated with this Qualification type that a user can take to obtain a Qualification of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey is present. A Qualification type cannot have both a specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true. 
--
-- * 'qtQualificationTypeId' - A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualification type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the CreateQualificationType operation. 
--
-- * 'qtName' - The name of the Qualification type. The type name is used to identify the type, and to find the type using a Qualification type search. 
--
-- * 'qtKeywords' - One or more words or phrases that describe theQualification type, separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to find using a search. 
--
-- * 'qtAutoGranted' - Specifies that requests for the Qualification type are granted immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test. Valid values are True | False.
--
-- * 'qtAutoGrantedValue' - The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default. 
--
-- * 'qtDescription' - A long description for the Qualification type. 
--
-- * 'qtIsRequestable' - Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test. This value is False for Qualifications assigned automatically by the system. Valid values are True | False. 
--
-- * 'qtRetryDelayInSeconds' - The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after taking the Qualification test before they can take it again. Workers can take a Qualification test multiple times if they were not granted the Qualification from a previous attempt, or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can request a Qualification only once.
