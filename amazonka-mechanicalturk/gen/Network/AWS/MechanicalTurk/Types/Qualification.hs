-- | Creates a value of 'Qualification' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'qStatus' - The status of the Qualification. Valid values are Granted | Revoked.
--
-- * 'qIntegerValue' - The value (score) of the Qualification, if the Qualification has an integer value.
--
-- * 'qLocaleValue' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'qQualificationTypeId' - The ID of the Qualification type for the Qualification.
--
-- * 'qGrantTime' - The date and time the Qualification was granted to the Worker. If the Worker's Qualification was revoked, and then re-granted based on a new Qualification request, GrantTime is the date and time of the last call to the AcceptQualificationRequest operation.
--
-- * 'qWorkerId' - The ID of the Worker who possesses the Qualification.
