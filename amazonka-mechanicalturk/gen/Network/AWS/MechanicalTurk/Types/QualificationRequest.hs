-- | Creates a value of 'QualificationRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'quaQualificationRequestId' - The ID of the Qualification request, a unique identifier generated when the request was submitted. 
--
-- * 'quaTest' - The contents of the Qualification test that was presented to the Worker, if the type has a test and the Worker has submitted answers. This value is identical to the QuestionForm associated with the Qualification type at the time the Worker requests the Qualification.
--
-- * 'quaQualificationTypeId' - The ID of the Qualification type the Worker is requesting, as returned by the CreateQualificationType operation. 
--
-- * 'quaAnswer' - The Worker's answers for the Qualification type's test contained in a QuestionFormAnswers document, if the type has a test and the Worker has submitted answers. If the Worker does not provide any answers, Answer may be empty. 
--
-- * 'quaWorkerId' - The ID of the Worker requesting the Qualification.
--
-- * 'quaSubmitTime' - The date and time the Qualification request had a status of Submitted. This is either the time the Worker submitted answers for a Qualification test, or the time the Worker requested the Qualification if the Qualification type does not have a test.
