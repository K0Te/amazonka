-- | Creates a value of 'Change' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cAction' - The action to perform:     * @CREATE@ : Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.     * @DELETE@ : Deletes a existing resource record set. /Important:/ To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance.html DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance> . Amazon Route 53 will delete the resource record set automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using @ChangeResourceRecordSets@ , Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue to be charged for it even though it's no longer in use.      * @UPSERT@ : If a resource record set doesn't already exist, Route 53 creates it. If a resource record set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.
--
-- * 'cResourceRecordSet' - Information about the resource record set to create, delete, or update.
