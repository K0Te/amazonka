-- | Creates a value of 'HostedZoneOwner' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hzoOwningAccount' - If the hosted zone was created by an AWS account, or was created by an AWS service that creates hosted zones using the current account, @OwningAccount@ contains the account ID of that account. For example, when you use AWS Cloud Map to create a hosted zone, Cloud Map creates the hosted zone using the current AWS account. 
--
-- * 'hzoOwningService' - If an AWS service uses its own account to create a hosted zone and associate the specified VPC with that hosted zone, @OwningService@ contains an abbreviation that identifies the service. For example, if Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) created a hosted zone and associated a VPC with the hosted zone, the value of @OwningService@ is @efs.amazonaws.com@ .
