-- | Creates a value of 'HealthCheck' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hcLinkedService' - If the health check was created by another service, the service that created the health check. When a health check is created by another service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53. 
--
-- * 'hcCloudWatchAlarmConfiguration' - A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is monitoring for this health check.
--
-- * 'hcId' - The identifier that Amazon Route 53assigned to the health check when you created it. When you add or update a resource record set, you use this value to specify which health check to use. The value can be up to 64 characters long. 
--
-- * 'hcCallerReference' - A unique string that you specified when you created the health check.
--
-- * 'hcHealthCheckConfig' - A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.
--
-- * 'hcHealthCheckVersion' - The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to @UpdateHealthCheck@ to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.
