-- | Creates a value of 'Tag' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tagValue' - The value of @Value@ depends on the operation that you want to perform:     * __Add a tag to a health check or hosted zone__ : @Value@ is the value that you want to give the new tag.     * __Edit a tag__ : @Value@ is the new value that you want to assign the tag.
--
-- * 'tagKey' - The value of @Key@ depends on the operation that you want to perform:     * __Add a tag to a health check or hosted zone__ : @Key@ is the name that you want to give the new tag.     * __Edit a tag__ : @Key@ is the name of the tag that you want to change the @Value@ for.     * __Delete a key__ : @Key@ is the name of the tag you want to remove.     * __Give a name to a health check__ : Edit the default @Name@ tag. In the Amazon Route 53 console, the list of your health checks includes a __Name__ column that lets you see the name that you've given to each health check.
