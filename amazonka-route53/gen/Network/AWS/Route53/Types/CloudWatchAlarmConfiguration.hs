-- | Creates a value of 'CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cwacDimensions' - For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, a complex type that contains information about the dimensions for the metric. For information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference> in the /Amazon CloudWatch User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cwacEvaluationPeriods' - For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that the metric is compared to the threshold.
--
-- * 'cwacThreshold' - For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is compared with.
--
-- * 'cwacComparisonOperator' - For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that is used for the comparison.
--
-- * 'cwacPeriod' - For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one evaluation period in seconds.
--
-- * 'cwacMetricName' - The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.
--
-- * 'cwacNamespace' - The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference> in the /Amazon CloudWatch User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cwacStatistic' - For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the statistic that is applied to the metric.
