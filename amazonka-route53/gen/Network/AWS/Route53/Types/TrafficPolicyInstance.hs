-- | Creates a value of 'TrafficPolicyInstance' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tpiId' - The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the new traffic policy instance.
--
-- * 'tpiHostedZoneId' - The ID of the hosted zone that Amazon Route 53 created resource record sets in.
--
-- * 'tpiName' - The DNS name, such as www.example.com, for which Amazon Route 53 responds to queries by using the resource record sets that are associated with this traffic policy instance. 
--
-- * 'tpiTTL' - The TTL that Amazon Route 53 assigned to all of the resource record sets that it created in the specified hosted zone.
--
-- * 'tpiState' - The value of @State@ is one of the following values:     * Applied    * Amazon Route 53 has finished creating resource record sets, and changes have propagated to all Route 53 edge locations.     * Creating    * Route 53 is creating the resource record sets.

--
-- * 'tpiMessage' - If @State@ is @Failed@ , an explanation of the reason for the failure. If @State@ is another value, @Message@ is empty.
--
-- * 'tpiTrafficPolicyId' - The ID of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to create resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.
--
-- * 'tpiTrafficPolicyVersion' - The version of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to create resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.
