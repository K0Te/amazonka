-- | Creates a value of 'ChangeInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ciComment' - A complex type that describes change information about changes made to your hosted zone. This element contains an ID that you use when performing a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetChange.html GetChange> action to get detailed information about the change.
--
-- * 'ciId' - The ID of the request.
--
-- * 'ciStatus' - The current state of the request. @PENDING@ indicates that this request has not yet been applied to all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers.
--
-- * 'ciSubmittedAt' - The date and time that the change request was submitted in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601 format> and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, the value @2017-03-27T17:48:16.751Z@ represents March 27, 2017 at 17:48:16.751 UTC.
