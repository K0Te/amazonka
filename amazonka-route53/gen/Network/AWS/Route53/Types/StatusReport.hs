-- | Creates a value of 'StatusReport' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'srStatus' - A description of the status of the health check endpoint as reported by one of the Amazon Route 53 health checkers.
--
-- * 'srCheckedTime' - The date and time that the health checker performed the health check in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601 format> and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, the value @2017-03-27T17:48:16.751Z@ represents March 27, 2017 at 17:48:16.751 UTC.
