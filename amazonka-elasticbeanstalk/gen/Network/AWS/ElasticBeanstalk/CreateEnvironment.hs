-- | Creates a value of 'CreateEnvironment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cCNAMEPrefix' - If specified, the environment attempts to use this value as the prefix for the CNAME in your Elastic Beanstalk environment URL. If not specified, the CNAME is generated automatically by appending a random alphanumeric string to the environment name.
--
-- * 'cTemplateName' - The name of the Elastic Beanstalk configuration template to use with the environment.
--
-- * 'cOptionsToRemove' - A list of custom user-defined configuration options to remove from the configuration set for this new environment.
--
-- * 'cOptionSettings' - If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk sets the specified configuration options to the requested value in the configuration set for the new environment. These override the values obtained from the solution stack or the configuration template.
--
-- * 'cVersionLabel' - The name of the application version to deploy. Default: If not specified, Elastic Beanstalk attempts to deploy the sample application.
--
-- * 'cOperationsRole' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to be used as the environment's operations role. If specified, Elastic Beanstalk uses the operations role for permissions to downstream services during this call and during subsequent calls acting on this environment. To specify an operations role, you must have the @iam:PassRole@ permission for the role. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-operationsrole.html Operations roles> in the /AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cPlatformARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom platform to use with the environment. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/custom-platforms.html Custom Platforms> in the /AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cTier' - Specifies the tier to use in creating this environment. The environment tier that you choose determines whether Elastic Beanstalk provisions resources to support a web application that handles HTTP(S) requests or a web application that handles background-processing tasks.
--
-- * 'cEnvironmentName' - A unique name for the environment. Constraint: Must be from 4 to 40 characters in length. The name can contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. It can't start or end with a hyphen. This name must be unique within a region in your account. If the specified name already exists in the region, Elastic Beanstalk returns an @InvalidParameterValue@ error.  If you don't specify the @CNAMEPrefix@ parameter, the environment name becomes part of the CNAME, and therefore part of the visible URL for your application.
--
-- * 'cSolutionStackName' - The name of an Elastic Beanstalk solution stack (platform version) to use with the environment. If specified, Elastic Beanstalk sets the configuration values to the default values associated with the specified solution stack. For a list of current solution stacks, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/platforms/platforms-supported.html Elastic Beanstalk Supported Platforms> in the /AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms/ guide.
--
-- * 'cGroupName' - The name of the group to which the target environment belongs. Specify a group name only if the environment's name is specified in an environment manifest and not with the environment name parameter. See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-cfg-manifest.html Environment Manifest (env.yaml)> for details.
--
-- * 'cDescription' - Your description for this environment.
--
-- * 'cTags' - Specifies the tags applied to resources in the environment.
--
-- * 'cApplicationName' - The name of the application that is associated with this environment.
