-- | Creates a value of 'InstanceHealthSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ihsOK' - __Green.__ An instance is passing health checks and the health agent is not reporting any problems.
--
-- * 'ihsPending' - __Grey.__ An operation is in progress on an instance within the command timeout.
--
-- * 'ihsSevere' - __Red.__ The health agent is reporting a very high number of request failures or other issues for an instance or environment.
--
-- * 'ihsUnknown' - __Grey.__ AWS Elastic Beanstalk and the health agent are reporting an insufficient amount of data on an instance.
--
-- * 'ihsNoData' - __Grey.__ AWS Elastic Beanstalk and the health agent are reporting no data on an instance.
--
-- * 'ihsWarning' - __Yellow.__ The health agent is reporting a moderate number of request failures or other issues for an instance or environment.
--
-- * 'ihsDegraded' - __Red.__ The health agent is reporting a high number of request failures or other issues for an instance or environment.
--
-- * 'ihsInfo' - __Green.__ An operation is in progress on an instance.
