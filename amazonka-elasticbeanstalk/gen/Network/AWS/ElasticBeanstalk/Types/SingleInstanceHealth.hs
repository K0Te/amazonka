-- | Creates a value of 'SingleInstanceHealth' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sihInstanceId' - The ID of the Amazon EC2 instance.
--
-- * 'sihCauses' - Represents the causes, which provide more information about the current health status.
--
-- * 'sihSystem' - Operating system metrics from the instance.
--
-- * 'sihApplicationMetrics' - Request metrics from your application.
--
-- * 'sihColor' - Represents the color indicator that gives you information about the health of the EC2 instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/health-enhanced-status.html Health Colors and Statuses> .
--
-- * 'sihInstanceType' - The instance's type.
--
-- * 'sihAvailabilityZone' - The availability zone in which the instance runs.
--
-- * 'sihHealthStatus' - Returns the health status of the specified instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/health-enhanced-status.html Health Colors and Statuses> .
--
-- * 'sihDeployment' - Information about the most recent deployment to an instance.
--
-- * 'sihLaunchedAt' - The time at which the EC2 instance was launched.
