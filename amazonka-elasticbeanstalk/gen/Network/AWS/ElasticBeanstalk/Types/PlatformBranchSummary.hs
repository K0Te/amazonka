-- | Creates a value of 'PlatformBranchSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pbsBranchName' - The name of the platform branch.
--
-- * 'pbsBranchOrder' - An ordinal number that designates the order in which platform branches have been added to a platform. This can be helpful, for example, if your code calls the @ListPlatformBranches@ action and then displays a list of platform branches. A larger @BranchOrder@ value designates a newer platform branch within the platform.
--
-- * 'pbsPlatformName' - The name of the platform to which this platform branch belongs.
--
-- * 'pbsSupportedTierList' - The environment tiers that platform versions in this branch support. Possible values: @WebServer/Standard@ | @Worker/SQS/HTTP@ 
--
-- * 'pbsLifecycleState' - The support life cycle state of the platform branch. Possible values: @beta@ | @supported@ | @deprecated@ | @retired@
