-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dDeploymentId' - The ID of the deployment. This number increases by one each time that you deploy source code or change instance configuration settings.
--
-- * 'dStatus' - The status of the deployment:     * @In Progress@ : The deployment is in progress.     * @Deployed@ : The deployment succeeded.     * @Failed@ : The deployment failed.
--
-- * 'dDeploymentTime' - For in-progress deployments, the time that the deployment started. For completed deployments, the time that the deployment ended.
--
-- * 'dVersionLabel' - The version label of the application version in the deployment.
