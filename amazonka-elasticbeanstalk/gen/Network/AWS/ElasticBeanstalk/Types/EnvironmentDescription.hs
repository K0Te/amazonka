-- | Creates a value of 'EnvironmentDescription' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eStatus' - The current operational status of the environment:     * @Launching@ : Environment is in the process of initial deployment.     * @Updating@ : Environment is in the process of updating its configuration settings or application version.     * @Ready@ : Environment is available to have an action performed on it, such as update or terminate.     * @Terminating@ : Environment is in the shut-down process.     * @Terminated@ : Environment is not running.
--
-- * 'eCNAME' - The URL to the CNAME for this environment.
--
-- * 'eTemplateName' - The name of the configuration template used to originally launch this environment.
--
-- * 'eAbortableOperationInProgress' - Indicates if there is an in-progress environment configuration update or application version deployment that you can cancel. @true:@ There is an update in progress.  @false:@ There are no updates currently in progress. 
--
-- * 'eEndpointURL' - For load-balanced, autoscaling environments, the URL to the LoadBalancer. For single-instance environments, the IP address of the instance.
--
-- * 'eResources' - The description of the AWS resources used by this environment.
--
-- * 'eDateUpdated' - The last modified date for this environment.
--
-- * 'eDateCreated' - The creation date for this environment.
--
-- * 'eHealth' - Describes the health status of the environment. AWS Elastic Beanstalk indicates the failure levels for a running environment:     * @Red@ : Indicates the environment is not responsive. Occurs when three or more consecutive failures occur for an environment.     * @Yellow@ : Indicates that something is wrong. Occurs when two consecutive failures occur for an environment.     * @Green@ : Indicates the environment is healthy and fully functional.     * @Grey@ : Default health for a new environment. The environment is not fully launched and health checks have not started or health checks are suspended during an @UpdateEnvironment@ or @RestartEnvironment@ request. Default: @Grey@ 
--
-- * 'eVersionLabel' - The application version deployed in this environment.
--
-- * 'eOperationsRole' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment's operations role. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-operationsrole.html Operations roles> in the /AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'ePlatformARN' - The ARN of the platform version.
--
-- * 'eTier' - Describes the current tier of this environment.
--
-- * 'eEnvironmentName' - The name of this environment.
--
-- * 'eApplicationName' - The name of the application associated with this environment.
--
-- * 'eEnvironmentARN' - The environment's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which can be used in other API requests that require an ARN.
--
-- * 'eSolutionStackName' - The name of the @SolutionStack@ deployed with this environment. 
--
-- * 'eEnvironmentId' - The ID of this environment.
--
-- * 'eHealthStatus' - Returns the health status of the application running in your environment. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/health-enhanced-status.html Health Colors and Statuses> .
--
-- * 'eEnvironmentLinks' - A list of links to other environments in the same group.
