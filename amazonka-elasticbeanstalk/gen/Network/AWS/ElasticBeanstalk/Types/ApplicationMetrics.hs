-- | Creates a value of 'ApplicationMetrics' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'amRequestCount' - Average number of requests handled by the web server per second over the last 10 seconds.
--
-- * 'amLatency' - Represents the average latency for the slowest X percent of requests over the last 10 seconds. Latencies are in seconds with one millisecond resolution.
--
-- * 'amStatusCodes' - Represents the percentage of requests over the last 10 seconds that resulted in each type of status code response.
--
-- * 'amDuration' - The amount of time that the metrics cover (usually 10 seconds). For example, you might have 5 requests (@request_count@ ) within the most recent time slice of 10 seconds (@duration@ ).
