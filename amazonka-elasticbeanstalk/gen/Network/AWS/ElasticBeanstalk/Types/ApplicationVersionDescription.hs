-- | Creates a value of 'ApplicationVersionDescription' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'avdStatus' - The processing status of the application version. Reflects the state of the application version during its creation. Many of the values are only applicable if you specified @True@ for the @Process@ parameter of the @CreateApplicationVersion@ action. The following list describes the possible values.     * @Unprocessed@ – Application version wasn't pre-processed or validated. Elastic Beanstalk will validate configuration files during deployment of the application version to an environment.     * @Processing@ – Elastic Beanstalk is currently processing the application version.     * @Building@ – Application version is currently undergoing an AWS CodeBuild build.     * @Processed@ – Elastic Beanstalk was successfully pre-processed and validated.     * @Failed@ – Either the AWS CodeBuild build failed or configuration files didn't pass validation. This application version isn't usable.
--
-- * 'avdSourceBundle' - The storage location of the application version's source bundle in Amazon S3.
--
-- * 'avdDateUpdated' - The last modified date of the application version.
--
-- * 'avdDateCreated' - The creation date of the application version.
--
-- * 'avdVersionLabel' - A unique identifier for the application version.
--
-- * 'avdSourceBuildInformation' - If the version's source code was retrieved from AWS CodeCommit, the location of the source code for the application version.
--
-- * 'avdApplicationName' - The name of the application to which the application version belongs.
--
-- * 'avdApplicationVersionARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application version.
--
-- * 'avdBuildARN' - Reference to the artifact from the AWS CodeBuild build.
--
-- * 'avdDescription' - The description of the application version.
