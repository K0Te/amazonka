-- | Creates a value of 'GetUsageForecast' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gufPredictionIntervalLevel' - Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast as a single point. You can request a prediction interval around the mean by specifying a confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confident Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the prediction interval. Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction intervals.
--
-- * 'gufFilter' - The filters that you want to use to filter your forecast. Cost Explorer API supports all of the Cost Explorer filters.
--
-- * 'gufTimePeriod' - The start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve usage forecast for. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if @start@ is @2017-01-01@ and @end@ is @2017-05-01@ , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from @2017-01-01@ up to and including @2017-04-30@ but not including @2017-05-01@ . The start date must be equal to or later than the current date to avoid a validation error.
--
-- * 'gufMetric' - Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast. Valid values for a @GetUsageForecast@ call are the following:     * USAGE_QUANTITY     * NORMALIZED_USAGE_AMOUNT
--
-- * 'gufGranularity' - How granular you want the forecast to be. You can get 3 months of @DAILY@ forecasts or 12 months of @MONTHLY@ forecasts. The @GetUsageForecast@ operation supports only @DAILY@ and @MONTHLY@ granularities.
