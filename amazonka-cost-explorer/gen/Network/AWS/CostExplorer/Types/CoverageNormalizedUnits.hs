-- | The amount of instance usage, in normalized units. Normalized units enable you to see your EC2 usage for multiple sizes of instances in a uniform way. For example, suppose you run an xlarge instance and a 2xlarge instance. If you run both instances for the same amount of time, the 2xlarge instance uses twice as much of your reservation as the xlarge instance, even though both instances show only one instance-hour. Using normalized units instead of instance-hours, the xlarge instance used 8 normalized units, and the 2xlarge instance used 16 normalized units.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:

-- * 'cnuCoverageNormalizedUnitsPercentage' - The percentage of your used instance normalized units that a reservation covers.
