-- | Creates a value of 'SavingsPlansUtilizationAggregates' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'spuaAmortizedCommitment' - The total amortized commitment for a Savings Plans. This includes the sum of the upfront and recurring Savings Plans fees.
--
-- * 'spuaSavings' - The amount saved by using existing Savings Plans. Savings returns both net savings from Savings Plans, as well as the @onDemandCostEquivalent@ of the Savings Plans when considering the utilization rate.
--
-- * 'spuaUtilization' - A ratio of your effectiveness of using existing Savings Plans to apply to workloads that are Savings Plans eligible.
