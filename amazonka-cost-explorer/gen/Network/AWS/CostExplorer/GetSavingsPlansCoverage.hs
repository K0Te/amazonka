-- Retrieves the Savings Plans covered for your account. This enables you to see how much of your cost is covered by a Savings Plan. An organizationâ€™s management account can see the coverage of the associated member accounts. This supports dimensions, Cost Categories, and nested expressions. For any time period, you can filter data for Savings Plans usage with the following dimensions:
--
--
--     * @LINKED_ACCOUNT@ 
--
--     * @REGION@ 
--
--     * @SERVICE@ 
--
--     * @INSTANCE_FAMILY@ 
--
--
--
-- To determine valid values for a dimension, use the @GetDimensionValues@ operation.

-- | Creates a value of 'GetSavingsPlansCoverage' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gspcGroupBy' - You can group the data using the attributes @INSTANCE_FAMILY@ , @REGION@ , or @SERVICE@ .
--
-- * 'gspcMetrics' - The measurement that you want your Savings Plans coverage reported in. The only valid value is @SpendCoveredBySavingsPlans@ .
--
-- * 'gspcGranularity' - The granularity of the Amazon Web Services cost data for your Savings Plans. @Granularity@ can't be set if @GroupBy@ is set. The @GetSavingsPlansCoverage@ operation supports only @DAILY@ and @MONTHLY@ granularities.
--
-- * 'gspcNextToken' - The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.
--
-- * 'gspcFilter' - Filters Savings Plans coverage data by dimensions. You can filter data for Savings Plans usage with the following dimensions:     * @LINKED_ACCOUNT@      * @REGION@      * @SERVICE@      * @INSTANCE_FAMILY@  @GetSavingsPlansCoverage@ uses the same <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html Expression> object as the other operations, but only @AND@ is supported among each dimension. If there are multiple values for a dimension, they are OR'd together. Cost category is also supported.
--
-- * 'gspcMaxResults' - The number of items to be returned in a response. The default is @20@ , with a minimum value of @1@ .
--
-- * 'gspcTimePeriod' - The time period that you want the usage and costs for. The @Start@ date must be within 13 months. The @End@ date must be after the @Start@ date, and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as an @End@ date.
