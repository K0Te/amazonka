-- | Creates a value of 'CPU' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cpuFrequency' - The CPU's frequency.
--
-- * 'cpuClock' - The clock speed of the device's CPU, expressed in hertz (Hz). For example, a 1.2 GHz CPU is expressed as 1200000000.

-- * 'cpuArchitecture' - The CPU's architecture (for example, x86 or ARM).
