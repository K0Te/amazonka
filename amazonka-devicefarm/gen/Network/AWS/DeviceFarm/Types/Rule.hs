-- | Creates a value of 'Rule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rAttribute' - The rule's stringified attribute. For example, specify the value as @"\"abc\""@ . The supported operators for each attribute are provided in the following list.     * APPIUM_VERSION    * The Appium version for the test. Supported operators: @CONTAINS@      * ARN    * The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, @arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example@ . Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * AVAILABILITY    * The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@      * FLEET_TYPE    * The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@      * FORM_FACTOR    * The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET. Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * INSTANCE_ARN    * The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance. Supported operators: @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * INSTANCE_LABELS    * The label of the device instance. Supported operators: @CONTAINS@      * MANUFACTURER    * The device manufacturer (for example, Apple). Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * MODEL    * The device model, such as Apple iPad Air 2 or Google Pixel. Supported operators: @CONTAINS@ , @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * OS_VERSION    * The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2). Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @GREATER_THAN@ , @GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @LESS_THAN@ , @LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS@ , @NOT_IN@      * PLATFORM    * The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS. Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED    * Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@      * REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED    * Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@  Because remote debugging is <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html no longer supported> , this filter is ignored.
--
-- * 'rOperator' - Specifies how Device Farm compares the rule's attribute to the value. For the operators that are supported by each attribute, see the attribute descriptions.
--
-- * 'rValue' - The rule's value.
