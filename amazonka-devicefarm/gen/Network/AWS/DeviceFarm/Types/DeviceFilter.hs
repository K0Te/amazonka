-- | Creates a value of 'DeviceFilter' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dfAttribute' - The aspect of a device such as platform or model used as the selection criteria in a device filter. The supported operators for each attribute are provided in the following list.     * ARN    * The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, @arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example@ ). Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * PLATFORM    * The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS. Supported operators: @EQUALS@      * OS_VERSION    * The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2). Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @GREATER_THAN@ , @GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @LESS_THAN@ , @LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS@ , @NOT_IN@      * MODEL    * The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen). Supported operators: @CONTAINS@ , @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * AVAILABILITY    * The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@      * FORM_FACTOR    * The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET. Supported operators: @EQUALS@      * MANUFACTURER    * The device manufacturer (for example, Apple). Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED    * Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@      * REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED    * Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@  Because remote debugging is <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html no longer supported> , this filter is ignored.     * INSTANCE_ARN    * The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance. Supported operators: @EQUALS@ , @IN@ , @NOT_IN@      * INSTANCE_LABELS    * The label of the device instance. Supported operators: @CONTAINS@      * FLEET_TYPE    * The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE. Supported operators: @EQUALS@ 
--
-- * 'dfOperator' - Specifies how Device Farm compares the filter's attribute to the value. See the attribute descriptions.
--
-- * 'dfValues' - An array of one or more filter values used in a device filter. __Operator Values__      * The IN and NOT_IN operators can take a values array that has more than one element.     * The other operators require an array with a single element. __Attribute Values__      * The PLATFORM attribute can be set to ANDROID or IOS.     * The AVAILABILITY attribute can be set to AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.     * The FORM_FACTOR attribute can be set to PHONE or TABLET.     * The FLEET_TYPE attribute can be set to PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
