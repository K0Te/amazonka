-- | Creates a value of 'Run' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'runBillingMethod' - Specifies the billing method for a test run: @metered@ or @unmetered@ . If the parameter is not specified, the default value is @metered@ .
--
-- * 'runSkipAppResign' - When set to @true@ , for private devices, Device Farm does not sign your app again. For public devices, Device Farm always signs your apps again. For more information about how Device Farm re-signs your apps, see <https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/faq/ Do you modify my app?> in the /AWS Device Farm FAQs/ .
--
-- * 'runStatus' - The run's status. Allowed values include:     * PENDING     * PENDING_CONCURRENCY     * PENDING_DEVICE     * PROCESSING     * SCHEDULING     * PREPARING     * RUNNING     * COMPLETED     * STOPPING
--
-- * 'runCustomerArtifactPaths' - Output @CustomerArtifactPaths@ object for the test run.
--
-- * 'runEventCount' - For fuzz tests, this is the number of events, between 1 and 10000, that the UI fuzz test should perform.
--
-- * 'runCounters' - The run's result counters.
--
-- * 'runPlatform' - The run's platform. Allowed values include:     * ANDROID     * IOS
--
-- * 'runSeed' - For fuzz tests, this is a seed to use for randomizing the UI fuzz test. Using the same seed value between tests ensures identical event sequences.
--
-- * 'runRadios' - Information about the radio states for the run.
--
-- * 'runArn' - The run's ARN.
--
-- * 'runLocation' - Information about the location that is used for the run.
--
-- * 'runCreated' - When the run was created.
--
-- * 'runLocale' - Information about the locale that is used for the run.
--
-- * 'runTestSpecARN' - The ARN of the YAML-formatted test specification for the run.
--
-- * 'runStopped' - The run's stop time.
--
-- * 'runResult' - The run's result. Allowed values include:     * PENDING     * PASSED     * WARNED     * FAILED     * SKIPPED     * ERRORED     * STOPPED
--
-- * 'runJobTimeoutMinutes' - The number of minutes the job executes before it times out.
--
-- * 'runCompletedJobs' - The total number of completed jobs.
--
-- * 'runResultCode' - Supporting field for the result field. Set only if @result@ is @SKIPPED@ . @PARSING_FAILED@ if the result is skipped because of test package parsing failure.
--
-- * 'runName' - The run's name.
--
-- * 'runAppUpload' - An app to upload or that has been uploaded.
--
-- * 'runParsingResultURL' - Read-only URL for an object in an S3 bucket where you can get the parsing results of the test package. If the test package doesn't parse, the reason why it doesn't parse appears in the file that this URL points to.
--
-- * 'runNetworkProfile' - The network profile being used for a test run.
--
-- * 'runDeviceMinutes' - Represents the total (metered or unmetered) minutes used by the test run.
--
-- * 'runType' - The run's type. Must be one of the following values:     * BUILTIN_FUZZ     * BUILTIN_EXPLORER     * APPIUM_JAVA_JUNIT     * APPIUM_JAVA_TESTNG     * APPIUM_PYTHON     * APPIUM_NODE     * APPIUM_RUBY     * APPIUM_WEB_JAVA_JUNIT     * APPIUM_WEB_JAVA_TESTNG     * APPIUM_WEB_PYTHON     * APPIUM_WEB_NODE     * APPIUM_WEB_RUBY     * CALABASH     * INSTRUMENTATION     * UIAUTOMATION     * UIAUTOMATOR     * XCTEST     * XCTEST_UI

--
-- * 'runDevicePoolARN' - The ARN of the device pool for the run.
--
-- * 'runStarted' - The run's start time.
--
