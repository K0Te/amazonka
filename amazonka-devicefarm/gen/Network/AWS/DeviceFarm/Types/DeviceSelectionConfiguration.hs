-- | Creates a value of 'DeviceSelectionConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dscFilters' - Used to dynamically select a set of devices for a test run. A filter is made up of an attribute, an operator, and one or more values.     * __Attribute__  The aspect of a device such as platform or model used as the selection criteria in a device filter. Allowed values include:     * ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, @arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example@ ).     * PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS.     * OS_VERSION: The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2).     * MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen).     * AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.     * FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET.     * MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer (for example, Apple).     * REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE.     * REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Because remote debugging is <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html no longer supported> , this filter is ignored.     * INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance.     * INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance.     * FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE.     * __Operator__  The filter operator.     * The EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except INSTANCE_LABELS.     * The CONTAINS operator is available for the INSTANCE_LABELS and MODEL attributes.     * The IN and NOT_IN operators are available for the ARN, OS_VERSION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes.     * The LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, and GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators are also available for the OS_VERSION attribute.     * __Values__  An array of one or more filter values. __Operator Values__      * The IN and NOT_IN operators can take a values array that has more than one element.     * The other operators require an array with a single element. __Attribute Values__      * The PLATFORM attribute can be set to ANDROID or IOS.     * The AVAILABILITY attribute can be set to AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.     * The FORM_FACTOR attribute can be set to PHONE or TABLET.     * The FLEET_TYPE attribute can be set to PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
--
-- * 'dscMaxDevices' - The maximum number of devices to be included in a test run.
