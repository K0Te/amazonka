-- | Creates a value of 'RemoteAccessSession' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rasBillingMethod' - The billing method of the remote access session. Possible values include @METERED@ or @UNMETERED@ . For more information about metered devices, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/welcome.html#welcome-terminology AWS Device Farm terminology> .
--
-- * 'rasClientId' - Unique identifier of your client for the remote access session. Only returned if remote debugging is enabled for the remote access session. Remote debugging is <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html no longer supported> .
--
-- * 'rasDeviceUdid' - Unique device identifier for the remote device. Only returned if remote debugging is enabled for the remote access session. Remote debugging is <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html no longer supported> .
--
-- * 'rasSkipAppResign' - When set to @true@ , for private devices, Device Farm does not sign your app again. For public devices, Device Farm always signs your apps again. For more information about how Device Farm re-signs your apps, see <https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/faq/ Do you modify my app?> in the /AWS Device Farm FAQs/ .
--
-- * 'rasInstanceARN' - The ARN of the instance.
--
-- * 'rasStatus' - The status of the remote access session. Can be any of the following:     * PENDING.     * PENDING_CONCURRENCY.     * PENDING_DEVICE.     * PROCESSING.     * SCHEDULING.     * PREPARING.     * RUNNING.     * COMPLETED.     * STOPPING.
--
-- * 'rasRemoteRecordEnabled' - This flag is set to @true@ if remote recording is enabled for the remote access session.
--
-- * 'rasArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the remote access session.
--
-- * 'rasRemoteRecordAppARN' - The ARN for the app to be recorded in the remote access session.
--
-- * 'rasCreated' - The date and time the remote access session was created.
--
-- * 'rasDevice' - The device (phone or tablet) used in the remote access session.
--
-- * 'rasStopped' - The date and time the remote access session was stopped.
--
-- * 'rasResult' - The result of the remote access session. Can be any of the following:     * PENDING.     * PASSED.     * WARNED.     * FAILED.     * SKIPPED.     * ERRORED.     * STOPPED.
--
-- * 'rasName' - The name of the remote access session.
--
-- * 'rasDeviceMinutes' - The number of minutes a device is used in a remote access session (including setup and teardown minutes).
--
-- * 'rasRemoteDebugEnabled' - This flag is set to @true@ if remote debugging is enabled for the remote access session. Remote debugging is <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html no longer supported> .
--
-- * 'rasEndpoint' - The endpoint for the remote access sesssion.
--
-- * 'rasMessage' - A message about the remote access session.
--
-- * 'rasHostAddress' - IP address of the EC2 host where you need to connect to remotely debug devices. Only returned if remote debugging is enabled for the remote access session. Remote debugging is <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html no longer supported> .
--
-- * 'rasInteractionMode' - The interaction mode of the remote access session. Valid values are:     * INTERACTIVE: You can interact with the iOS device by viewing, touching, and rotating the screen. You cannot run XCUITest framework-based tests in this mode.     * NO_VIDEO: You are connected to the device, but cannot interact with it or view the screen. This mode has the fastest test execution speed. You can run XCUITest framework-based tests in this mode.     * VIDEO_ONLY: You can view the screen, but cannot touch or rotate it. You can run XCUITest framework-based tests and watch the screen in this mode.
--
-- * 'rasStarted' - The date and time the remote access session was started.
