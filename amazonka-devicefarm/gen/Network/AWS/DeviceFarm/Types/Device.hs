-- * 'dPlatform' - The device's platform. Allowed values include:     * ANDROID     * IOS
--
-- * 'dModelId' - The device's model ID.
--
-- * 'dRemoteAccessEnabled' - Specifies whether remote access has been enabled for the specified device.
--
-- * 'dArn' - The device's ARN.
--
-- * 'dFormFactor' - The device's form factor. Allowed values include:     * PHONE     * TABLET
--
-- * 'dFleetType' - The type of fleet to which this device belongs. Possible values are PRIVATE and PUBLIC.
