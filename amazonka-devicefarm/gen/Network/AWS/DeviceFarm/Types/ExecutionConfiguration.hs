-- | Creates a value of 'ExecutionConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ecSkipAppResign' - When set to @true@ , for private devices, Device Farm does not sign your app again. For public devices, Device Farm always signs your apps again. For more information about how Device Farm re-signs your apps, see <https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/faq/ Do you modify my app?> in the /AWS Device Farm FAQs/ .
--
-- * 'ecAccountsCleanup' - True if account cleanup is enabled at the beginning of the test. Otherwise, false.
--
-- * 'ecAppPackagesCleanup' - True if app package cleanup is enabled at the beginning of the test. Otherwise, false.
--
-- * 'ecJobTimeoutMinutes' - The number of minutes a test run executes before it times out.
--
-- * 'ecVideoCapture' - Set to true to enable video capture. Otherwise, set to false. The default is true.
