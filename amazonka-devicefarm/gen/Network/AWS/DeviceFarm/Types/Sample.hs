-- | Creates a value of 'Sample' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'samArn' - The sample's ARN.
--
-- * 'samUrl' - The presigned Amazon S3 URL that can be used with a GET request to download the sample's file.
--
-- * 'samType' - The sample's type. Must be one of the following values:     * CPU: A CPU sample type. This is expressed as the app processing CPU time (including child processes) as reported by process, as a percentage.     * MEMORY: A memory usage sample type. This is expressed as the total proportional set size of an app process, in kilobytes.     * NATIVE_AVG_DRAWTIME     * NATIVE_FPS     * NATIVE_FRAMES     * NATIVE_MAX_DRAWTIME     * NATIVE_MIN_DRAWTIME     * OPENGL_AVG_DRAWTIME     * OPENGL_FPS     * OPENGL_FRAMES     * OPENGL_MAX_DRAWTIME     * OPENGL_MIN_DRAWTIME     * RX     * RX_RATE: The total number of bytes per second (TCP and UDP) that are sent, by app process.     * THREADS: A threads sample type. This is expressed as the total number of threads per app process.     * TX     * TX_RATE: The total number of bytes per second (TCP and UDP) that are received, by app process.
