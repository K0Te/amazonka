-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sStreamLabel' - A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream. Note that @LatestStreamLabel@ is not a unique identifier for the stream, because it is possible that a stream from another table might have the same timestamp. However, the combination of the following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:     * the AWS customer ID.     * the table name     * the @StreamLabel@ 
--
-- * 'sStreamARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream.
--
-- * 'sTableName' - The DynamoDB table with which the stream is associated.
