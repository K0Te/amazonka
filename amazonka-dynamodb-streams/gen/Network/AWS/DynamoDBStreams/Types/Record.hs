-- | Creates a value of 'Record' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rUserIdentity' - Items that are deleted by the Time to Live process after expiration have the following fields:      * Records[].userIdentity.type "Service"     * Records[].userIdentity.principalId "dynamodb.amazonaws.com"
--
-- * 'rEventVersion' - The version number of the stream record format. This number is updated whenever the structure of @Record@ is modified. Client applications must not assume that @eventVersion@ will remain at a particular value, as this number is subject to change at any time. In general, @eventVersion@ will only increase as the low-level DynamoDB Streams API evolves.
--
-- * 'rDynamodb' - The main body of the stream record, containing all of the DynamoDB-specific fields.
--
-- * 'rAwsRegion' - The region in which the @GetRecords@ request was received.
--
-- * 'rEventName' - The type of data modification that was performed on the DynamoDB table:     * @INSERT@ - a new item was added to the table.     * @MODIFY@ - one or more of an existing item's attributes were modified.     * @REMOVE@ - the item was deleted from the table
--
-- * 'rEventSource' - The AWS service from which the stream record originated. For DynamoDB Streams, this is @aws:dynamodb@ .
--
-- * 'rEventId' - A globally unique identifier for the event that was recorded in this stream record.
