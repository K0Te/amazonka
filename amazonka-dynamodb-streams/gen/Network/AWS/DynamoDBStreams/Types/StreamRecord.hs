-- | Creates a value of 'StreamRecord' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'srSizeBytes' - The size of the stream record, in bytes.
--
-- * 'srSequenceNumber' - The sequence number of the stream record.
--
-- * 'srApproximateCreationDateTime' - The approximate date and time when the stream record was created, in <http://www.epochconverter.com/ UNIX epoch time> format.
--
-- * 'srStreamViewType' - The type of data from the modified DynamoDB item that was captured in this stream record:     * @KEYS_ONLY@ - only the key attributes of the modified item.     * @NEW_IMAGE@ - the entire item, as it appeared after it was modified.     * @OLD_IMAGE@ - the entire item, as it appeared before it was modified.     * @NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES@ - both the new and the old item images of the item.
--
-- * 'srKeys' - The primary key attribute(s) for the DynamoDB item that was modified.
--
-- * 'srOldImage' - The item in the DynamoDB table as it appeared before it was modified.
--
-- * 'srNewImage' - The item in the DynamoDB table as it appeared after it was modified.
