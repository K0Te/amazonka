-- | Creates a value of 'SuspendedState' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ssDynamicScalingInSuspended' - Whether scale in by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to @true@ if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to remove capacity when a scaling policy is triggered. The default is @false@ . 
--
-- * 'ssScheduledScalingSuspended' - Whether scheduled scaling is suspended. Set the value to @true@ if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to add or remove capacity by initiating scheduled actions. The default is @false@ . 
--
-- * 'ssDynamicScalingOutSuspended' - Whether scale out by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to @true@ if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to add capacity when a scaling policy is triggered. The default is @false@ .
