-- | Creates a value of 'StepScalingPolicyConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sspcStepAdjustments' - A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach. At least one step adjustment is required if you are adding a new step scaling policy configuration.
--
-- * 'sspcAdjustmentType' - Specifies how the @ScalingAdjustment@ value in a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_StepAdjustment.html StepAdjustment> is interpreted (for example, an absolute number or a percentage). The valid values are @ChangeInCapacity@ , @ExactCapacity@ , and @PercentChangeInCapacity@ .  @AdjustmentType@ is required if you are adding a new step scaling policy configuration.
--
-- * 'sspcCooldown' - The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect.  With scale-out policies, the intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. After Application Auto Scaling successfully scales out using a step scaling policy, it starts to calculate the cooldown time. The scaling policy won't increase the desired capacity again unless either a larger scale out is triggered or the cooldown period ends. While the cooldown period is in effect, capacity added by the initiating scale-out activity is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale-out activity. For example, when an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to increase the capacity by 2, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown period starts. If the alarm triggers again during the cooldown period but at a more aggressive step adjustment of 3, the previous increase of 2 is considered part of the current capacity. Therefore, only 1 is added to the capacity. With scale-in policies, the intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application’s availability, so scale-in activities are blocked until the cooldown period has expired. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out activity during the cooldown period after a scale-in activity, Application Auto Scaling scales out the target immediately. In this case, the cooldown period for the scale-in activity stops and doesn't complete. Application Auto Scaling provides a default value of 300 for the following scalable targets:     * ECS services     * Spot Fleet requests     * EMR clusters     * AppStream 2.0 fleets     * Aurora DB clusters     * Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants     * Custom resources For all other scalable targets, the default value is 0:     * DynamoDB tables     * DynamoDB global secondary indexes     * Amazon Comprehend document classification and entity recognizer endpoints     * Lambda provisioned concurrency     * Amazon Keyspaces tables     * Amazon MSK cluster storage
--
-- * 'sspcMetricAggregationType' - The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. Valid values are @Minimum@ , @Maximum@ , and @Average@ . If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as @Average@ .
--
-- * 'sspcMinAdjustmentMagnitude' - The minimum value to scale by when the adjustment type is @PercentChangeInCapacity@ . For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service by 25 percent and you specify a @MinAdjustmentMagnitude@ of 2. If the service has 4 tasks and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a @MinAdjustmentMagnitude@ of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the service by 2 tasks.
