-- When the notification settings are defined during job creation, you can choose to notify based on a specific set of job states using the @JobStatesToNotify@ array of strings, or you can specify that you want to have Amazon SNS notifications sent out for all job states with @NotifyAll@ set to true.

-- | Creates a value of 'Notification' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'nNotifyAll' - Any change in job state will trigger a notification for this job.
--
-- * 'nSNSTopicARN' - The new SNS @TopicArn@ that you want to associate with this job. You can create Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for topics by using the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_CreateTopic.html CreateTopic> Amazon SNS API action. You can subscribe email addresses to an Amazon SNS topic through the AWS Management Console, or by using the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Subscribe.html Subscribe> AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) API action.
