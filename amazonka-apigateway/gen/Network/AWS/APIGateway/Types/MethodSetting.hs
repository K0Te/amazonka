-- | Creates a value of 'MethodSetting' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'msCacheTtlInSeconds' - Specifies the time to live (TTL), in seconds, for cached responses. The higher the TTL, the longer the response will be cached. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/caching/ttlInSeconds@ , and the value is an integer.
--
-- * 'msDataTraceEnabled' - Specifies whether data trace logging is enabled for this method, which affects the log entries pushed to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/logging/dataTrace@ , and the value is a Boolean.
--
-- * 'msThrottlingBurstLimit' - Specifies the throttling burst limit. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/throttling/burstLimit@ , and the value is an integer.
--
-- * 'msCacheDataEncrypted' - Specifies whether the cached responses are encrypted. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/caching/dataEncrypted@ , and the value is a Boolean.
--
-- * 'msLoggingLevel' - Specifies the logging level for this method, which affects the log entries pushed to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/logging/loglevel@ , and the available levels are @OFF@ , @ERROR@ , and @INFO@ . Choose @ERROR@ to write only error-level entries to CloudWatch Logs, or choose @INFO@ to include all @ERROR@ events as well as extra informational events.
--
-- * 'msRequireAuthorizationForCacheControl' - Specifies whether authorization is required for a cache invalidation request. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/caching/requireAuthorizationForCacheControl@ , and the value is a Boolean.
--
-- * 'msCachingEnabled' - Specifies whether responses should be cached and returned for requests. A cache cluster must be enabled on the stage for responses to be cached. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/caching/enabled@ , and the value is a Boolean.
--
-- * 'msMetricsEnabled' - Specifies whether Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for this method. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/metrics/enabled@ , and the value is a Boolean.
--
-- * 'msThrottlingRateLimit' - Specifies the throttling rate limit. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/throttling/rateLimit@ , and the value is a double.
--
-- * 'msUnauthorizedCacheControlHeaderStrategy' - Specifies how to handle unauthorized requests for cache invalidation. The PATCH path for this setting is @/{method_setting_key}/caching/unauthorizedCacheControlHeaderStrategy@ , and the available values are @FAIL_WITH_403@ , @SUCCEED_WITH_RESPONSE_HEADER@ , @SUCCEED_WITHOUT_RESPONSE_HEADER@ .
