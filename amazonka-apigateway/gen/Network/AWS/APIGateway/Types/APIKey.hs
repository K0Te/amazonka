-- | Creates a value of 'APIKey' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'akEnabled' - Specifies whether the API Key can be used by callers.
--
-- * 'akValue' - The value of the API Key.
--
-- * 'akCustomerId' - An AWS Marketplace customer identifier , when integrating with the AWS SaaS Marketplace.
--
-- * 'akCreatedDate' - The timestamp when the API Key was created.
--
-- * 'akName' - The name of the API Key.
--
-- * 'akId' - The identifier of the API Key.
--
-- * 'akStageKeys' - A list of 'Stage' resources that are associated with the 'ApiKey' resource.
--
-- * 'akLastUpdatedDate' - The timestamp when the API Key was last updated.
--
-- * 'akDescription' - The description of the API Key.
--
-- * 'akTags' - The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a given resource.
