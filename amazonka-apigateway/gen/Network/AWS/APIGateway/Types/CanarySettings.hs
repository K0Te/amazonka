-- | Creates a value of 'CanarySettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'csDeploymentId' - The ID of the canary deployment.
--
-- * 'csStageVariableOverrides' - Stage variables overridden for a canary release deployment, including new stage variables introduced in the canary. These stage variables are represented as a string-to-string map between stage variable names and their values.
--
-- * 'csUseStageCache' - A Boolean flag to indicate whether the canary deployment uses the stage cache or not.
--
-- * 'csPercentTraffic' - The percent (0-100) of traffic diverted to a canary deployment.
