-- * 'tcInsecureSkipVerification' - Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the certificate for an integration endpoint is issued by a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-supported-certificate-authorities-for-http-endpoints.html supported certificate authority> . This isn’t recommended, but it enables you to use certificates that are signed by private certificate authorities, or certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API Gateway still performs basic certificate validation, which includes checking the certificate's expiration date, hostname, and presence of a root certificate authority. Supported only for @HTTP@ and @HTTP_PROXY@ integrations.
