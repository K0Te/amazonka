-- | Creates a value of 'PatchOperation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'poOp' - An update operation to be performed with this PATCH request. The valid value can be @add@ , @remove@ , @replace@ or @copy@ . Not all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Support of the operations depends on specific operational contexts. Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will return an error message.
--
-- * 'poPath' - The @op@ operation's target, as identified by a <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-08 JSON Pointer> value that references a location within the targeted resource. For example, if the target resource has an updateable property of @{"name":"value"}@ , the path for this property is @/name@ . If the @name@ property value is a JSON object (e.g., @{"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}}@ ), the path for the @child/name@ property will be @/name/child~1name@ . Any slash ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped with "~1", as shown in the example above. Each @op@ operation can have only one @path@ associated with it.
--
-- * 'poValue' - The new target value of the update operation. It is applicable for the @add@ or @replace@ operation. When using AWS CLI to update a property of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a": ...}'. In a Windows shell, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json Using JSON for Parameters> .
--
-- * 'poFrom' - The @copy@ update operation's source as identified by a @JSON-Pointer@ value referencing the location within the targeted resource to copy the value from. For example, to promote a canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on a 'Stage' resource with @"op":"copy"@ , @"from":"/canarySettings/deploymentId"@ and @"path":"/deploymentId"@ .
