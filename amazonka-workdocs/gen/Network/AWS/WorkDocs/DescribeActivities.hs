-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeActivities' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'daResourceId' - The document or folder ID for which to describe activity types.
--
-- * 'daIncludeIndirectActivities' - Includes indirect activities. An indirect activity results from a direct activity performed on a parent resource. For example, sharing a parent folder (the direct activity) shares all of the subfolders and documents within the parent folder (the indirect activity).
--
-- * 'daStartTime' - The timestamp that determines the starting time of the activities. The response includes the activities performed after the specified timestamp.
--
-- * 'daAuthenticationToken' - Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. Not required when using AWS administrator credentials to access the API.
--
-- * 'daUserId' - The ID of the user who performed the action. The response includes activities pertaining to this user. This is an optional parameter and is only applicable for administrative API (SigV4) requests.
--
-- * 'daMarker' - The marker for the next set of results.
--
-- * 'daEndTime' - The timestamp that determines the end time of the activities. The response includes the activities performed before the specified timestamp.
--
-- * 'daLimit' - The maximum number of items to return.
--
-- * 'daActivityTypes' - Specifies which activity types to include in the response. If this field is left empty, all activity types are returned.
--
-- * 'daOrganizationId' - The ID of the organization. This is a mandatory parameter when using administrative API (SigV4) requests.
