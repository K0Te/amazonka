-- | Creates a value of 'Activity' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aResourceMetadata' - The metadata of the resource involved in the user action.
--
-- * 'aIsIndirectActivity' - Indicates whether an activity is indirect or direct. An indirect activity results from a direct activity performed on a parent resource. For example, sharing a parent folder (the direct activity) shares all of the subfolders and documents within the parent folder (the indirect activity).
--
-- * 'aInitiator' - The user who performed the action.
--
-- * 'aParticipants' - The list of users or groups impacted by this action. This is an optional field and is filled for the following sharing activities: DOCUMENT_SHARED, DOCUMENT_SHARED, DOCUMENT_UNSHARED, FOLDER_SHARED, FOLDER_UNSHARED.
--
-- * 'aOriginalParent' - The original parent of the resource. This is an optional field and is filled for move activities.
--
-- * 'aType' - The activity type.
--
-- * 'aCommentMetadata' - Metadata of the commenting activity. This is an optional field and is filled for commenting activities.
--
-- * 'aTimeStamp' - The timestamp when the action was performed.
--
-- * 'aOrganizationId' - The ID of the organization.
