-- | Creates a value of 'Comment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

--
-- * 'cThreadId' - The ID of the root comment in the thread.
--
-- * 'cContributor' - The details of the user who made the comment.
--
-- * 'cCreatedTimestamp' - The time that the comment was created.
--
-- * 'cRecipientId' - If the comment is a reply to another user's comment, this field contains the user ID of the user being replied to.
