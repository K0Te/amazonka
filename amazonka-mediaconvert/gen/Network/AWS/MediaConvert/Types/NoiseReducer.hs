-- | Enable the Noise reducer (NoiseReducer) feature to remove noise from your video output if necessary. Enable or disable this feature for each output individually.

-- | Creates a value of 'NoiseReducer' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'nrTemporalFilterSettings' - Noise reducer filter settings for temporal filter.
--
-- * 'nrSpatialFilterSettings' - Noise reducer filter settings for spatial filter.
--
-- * 'nrFilterSettings' - Settings for a noise reducer filter
--
-- * 'nrFilter' - Use Noise reducer filter (NoiseReducerFilter) to select one of the following spatial image filtering functions. To use this setting, you must also enable Noise reducer (NoiseReducer). * Bilateral preserves edges while reducing noise. * Mean (softest), Gaussian, Lanczos, and Sharpen (sharpest) do convolution filtering. * Conserve does min/max noise reduction. * Spatial does frequency-domain filtering based on JND principles. * Temporal optimizes video quality for complex motion.
