-- | Creates a value of 'ReservationPlanSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rpsCommitment' - The length of the term of your reserved queue pricing plan commitment.
--
-- * 'rpsReservedSlots' - Specifies the number of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for this queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. You can't decrease the number of RTS in your reserved queue. You can increase the number of RTS by extending your existing commitment with a new 12-month commitment for the larger number. The new commitment begins when you purchase the additional capacity. You can't cancel your commitment or revert to your original commitment after you increase the capacity.
--
-- * 'rpsRenewalType' - Specifies whether the term of your reserved queue pricing plan is automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or expires (EXPIRE) at the end of the term. When your term is auto renewed, you extend your commitment by 12 months from the auto renew date. You can cancel this commitment.
