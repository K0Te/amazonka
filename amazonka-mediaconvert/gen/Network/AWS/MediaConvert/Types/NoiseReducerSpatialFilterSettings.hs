-- | Creates a value of 'NoiseReducerSpatialFilterSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'nrsfsStrength' - Relative strength of noise reducing filter. Higher values produce stronger filtering.
--
-- * 'nrsfsPostFilterSharpenStrength' - Specify strength of post noise reduction sharpening filter, with 0 disabling the filter and 3 enabling it at maximum strength.
--
-- * 'nrsfsSpeed' - The speed of the filter, from -2 (lower speed) to 3 (higher speed), with 0 being the nominal value.
