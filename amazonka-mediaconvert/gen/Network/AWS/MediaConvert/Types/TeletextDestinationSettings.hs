-- | Creates a value of 'TeletextDestinationSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tdsPageTypes' - Specify the page types for this Teletext page. If you don't specify a value here, the service sets the page type to the default value Subtitle (PAGE_TYPE_SUBTITLE). If you pass through the entire set of Teletext data, don't use this field. When you pass through a set of Teletext pages, your output has the same page types as your input.
--
-- * 'tdsPageNumber' - Set pageNumber to the Teletext page number for the destination captions for this output. This value must be a three-digit hexadecimal string; strings ending in -FF are invalid. If you are passing through the entire set of Teletext data, do not use this field.
