-- | Creates a value of 'ReservationPlan' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rpStatus' - Specifies whether the pricing plan for your reserved queue is ACTIVE or EXPIRED.
--
-- * 'rpExpiresAt' - The timestamp in epoch seconds for when the current pricing plan term for this reserved queue expires.
--
-- * 'rpPurchasedAt' - The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you set up the current pricing plan for this reserved queue.
--
-- * 'rpCommitment' - The length of the term of your reserved queue pricing plan commitment.
--
-- * 'rpReservedSlots' - Specifies the number of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for this queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. When you increase this number, you extend your existing commitment with a new 12-month commitment for a larger number of RTS. The new commitment begins when you purchase the additional capacity. You can't decrease the number of RTS in your reserved queue.
--
-- * 'rpRenewalType' - Specifies whether the term of your reserved queue pricing plan is automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or expires (EXPIRE) at the end of the term.
