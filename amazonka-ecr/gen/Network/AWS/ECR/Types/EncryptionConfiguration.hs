-- | The encryption configuration for the repository. This determines how the contents of your repository are encrypted at rest.
--
--
-- By default, when no encryption configuration is set or the @AES256@ encryption type is used, Amazon ECR uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys which encrypts your data at rest using an AES-256 encryption algorithm. This does not require any action on your part.
--
-- For more control over the encryption of the contents of your repository, you can use server-side encryption with customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt your images. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/encryption-at-rest.html Amazon ECR encryption at rest> in the /Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide/ .

-- | Creates a value of 'EncryptionConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ecKmsKey' - If you use the @KMS@ encryption type, specify the CMK to use for encryption. The alias, key ID, or full ARN of the CMK can be specified. The key must exist in the same Region as the repository. If no key is specified, the default AWS managed CMK for Amazon ECR will be used.
--
-- * 'ecEncryptionType' - The encryption type to use. If you use the @KMS@ encryption type, the contents of the repository will be encrypted using server-side encryption with customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS KMS. When you use AWS KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the default AWS managed CMK for Amazon ECR, or specify your own CMK, which you already created. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Console Developer Guide./ . If you use the @AES256@ encryption type, Amazon ECR uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys which encrypts the images in the repository using an AES-256 encryption algorithm. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3)> in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Console Developer Guide./ .
