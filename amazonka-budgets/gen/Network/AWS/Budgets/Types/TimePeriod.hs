-- | Creates a value of 'TimePeriod' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tpStart' - The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose @DAILY@ , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to @01/24/18 00:00 UTC@ . If you chose @MONTHLY@ , AWS set your start date to @01/01/18 00:00 UTC@ . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API. You can change your start date with the @UpdateBudget@ operation.
--
-- * 'tpEnd' - The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to @06/15/87 00:00 UTC@ . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API. After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers. You can change your end date with the @UpdateBudget@ operation.
