-- | A notification that is associated with a budget. A budget can have up to ten notifications. 
--
--
-- Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.
--
-- For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:
--
--     * A notificationType of @ACTUAL@ 
--
--     * A @thresholdType@ of @PERCENTAGE@ 
--
--     * A @comparisonOperator@ of @GREATER_THAN@ 
--
--     * A notification @threshold@ of @80@

-- | Creates a value of 'Notification' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'nThresholdType' - The type of threshold for a notification. For @ABSOLUTE_VALUE@ thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For @PERCENTAGE@ thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a @PERCENTAGE@ threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.
--
-- * 'nNotificationState' - Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the @ALARM@ state, you have passed the set threshold for the budget.
--
-- * 'nNotificationType' - Whether the notification is for how much you have spent (@ACTUAL@ ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (@FORECASTED@ ).
--
-- * 'nComparisonOperator' - The comparison that is used for this notification.
--
-- * 'nThreshold' - The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.
