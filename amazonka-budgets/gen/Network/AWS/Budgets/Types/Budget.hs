-- | Creates a value of 'Budget' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bCalculatedSpend' - The actual and forecasted cost or usage that the budget tracks.
--
-- * 'bPlannedBudgetLimits' - A map containing multiple @BudgetLimit@ , including current or future limits. @PlannedBudgetLimits@ is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and quarterly @TimeUnit@ .  For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of @PlannedBudgetLimits@ values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The @key@ is the start of the month, @UTC@ in epoch seconds.  For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of @PlannedBudgetLimits@ value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The @key@ is the start of the quarter, @UTC@ in epoch seconds.  If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the @PlannedBudgetLimits@ values only for the remaining periods. If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide @PlannedBudgetLimits@ values from the start date of the budget.  After all of the @BudgetLimit@ values in @PlannedBudgetLimits@ are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the @BudgetLimit@ . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.  @DescribeBudget@ and @DescribeBudgets@ response along with @PlannedBudgetLimits@ will also contain @BudgetLimit@ representing the current month or quarter limit present in @PlannedBudgetLimits@ . This only applies to budgets created with @PlannedBudgetLimits@ . Budgets created without @PlannedBudgetLimits@ will only contain @BudgetLimit@ , and no @PlannedBudgetLimits@ .
--
-- * 'bLastUpdatedTime' - The last time that you updated this budget.
--
-- * 'bBudgetLimit' - The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget. @BudgetLimit@ is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to @100@ , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use @BudgetLimit@ with @PlannedBudgetLimits@ for @CreateBudget@ and @UpdateBudget@ actions. 
--
-- * 'bTimePeriod' - The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an end date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come before @06/15/87 00:00 UTC@ .  If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose @DAILY@ , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to @01/24/18 00:00 UTC@ . If you chose @MONTHLY@ , AWS set your start date to @01/01/18 00:00 UTC@ . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to @06/15/87 00:00 UTC@ . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.  You can change either date with the @UpdateBudget@ operation. After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers.
--
-- * 'bCostTypes' - The types of costs that are included in this @COST@ budget. @USAGE@ , @RI_UTILIZATION@ , @RI_COVERAGE@ , @SAVINGS_PLANS_UTILIZATION@ , and @SAVINGS_PLANS_COVERAGE@ budgets do not have @CostTypes@ .
--
-- * 'bCostFilters' - The cost filters, such as service or tag, that are applied to a budget. AWS Budgets supports the following services as a filter for RI budgets:     * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute     * Amazon Redshift     * Amazon Relational Database Service     * Amazon ElastiCache     * Amazon Elasticsearch Service
--
-- * 'bBudgetName' - The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The @:@ and @\@ characters aren't allowed in @BudgetName@ .
--
-- * 'bTimeUnit' - The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend.
--
-- * 'bBudgetType' - Whether this budget tracks costs, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage.
