-- | Creates a value of 'UserImportJobType' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'uijtStatus' - The status of the user import job. One of the following:     * @Created@ - The job was created but not started.     * @Pending@ - A transition state. You have started the job, but it has not begun importing users yet.     * @InProgress@ - The job has started, and users are being imported.     * @Stopping@ - You have stopped the job, but the job has not stopped importing users yet.     * @Stopped@ - You have stopped the job, and the job has stopped importing users.     * @Succeeded@ - The job has completed successfully.     * @Failed@ - The job has stopped due to an error.     * @Expired@ - You created a job, but did not start the job within 24-48 hours. All data associated with the job was deleted, and the job cannot be started.
--
-- * 'uijtSkippedUsers' - The number of users that were skipped.
--
-- * 'uijtJobId' - The job ID for the user import job.
--
-- * 'uijtUserPoolId' - The user pool ID for the user pool that the users are being imported into.
--
-- * 'uijtJobName' - The job name for the user import job.
--
-- * 'uijtPreSignedURL' - The pre-signed URL to be used to upload the @.csv@ file.
--
-- * 'uijtFailedUsers' - The number of users that could not be imported.
--
-- * 'uijtStartDate' - The date when the user import job was started.
--
-- * 'uijtCompletionMessage' - The message returned when the user import job is completed.
--
-- * 'uijtCreationDate' - The date the user import job was created.
--
-- * 'uijtCompletionDate' - The date when the user import job was completed.
--
-- * 'uijtCloudWatchLogsRoleARN' - The role ARN for the Amazon CloudWatch Logging role for the user import job. For more information, see "Creating the CloudWatch Logs IAM Role" in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.
--
-- * 'uijtImportedUsers' - The number of users that were successfully imported.
