-- | Creates a value of 'PasswordPolicyType' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pptRequireNumbers' - In the password policy that you have set, refers to whether you have required users to use at least one number in their password.
--
-- * 'pptRequireUppercase' - In the password policy that you have set, refers to whether you have required users to use at least one uppercase letter in their password.
--
-- * 'pptRequireLowercase' - In the password policy that you have set, refers to whether you have required users to use at least one lowercase letter in their password.
--
-- * 'pptMinimumLength' - The minimum length of the password policy that you have set. Cannot be less than 6.
--
-- * 'pptRequireSymbols' - In the password policy that you have set, refers to whether you have required users to use at least one symbol in their password.
--
-- * 'pptTemporaryPasswordValidityDays' - In the password policy you have set, refers to the number of days a temporary password is valid. If the user does not sign-in during this time, their password will need to be reset by an administrator.
