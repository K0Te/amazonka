-- | Creates a value of 'NotifyConfigurationType' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'nctNoActionEmail' - The email template used when a detected risk event is allowed.
--
-- * 'nctFrom' - The email address that is sending the email. It must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.
--
-- * 'nctReplyTo' - The destination to which the receiver of an email should reply to.
--
-- * 'nctBlockEmail' - Email template used when a detected risk event is blocked.
--
-- * 'nctMFAEmail' - The MFA email template used when MFA is challenged as part of a detected risk.
--
-- * 'nctSourceARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy. It permits Amazon Cognito to send for the email address specified in the @From@ parameter.
