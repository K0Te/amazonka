-- | Creates a value of 'BGPPeer' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bpCustomerAddress' - The IP address assigned to the customer interface.
--
-- * 'bpAmazonAddress' - The IP address assigned to the Amazon interface.
--
-- * 'bpAddressFamily' - The address family for the BGP peer.
--
-- * 'bpBgpStatus' - The status of the BGP peer. The following are the possible values:     * @up@ : The BGP peer is established. This state does not indicate the state of the routing function. Ensure that you are receiving routes over the BGP session.     * @down@ : The BGP peer is down.     * @unknown@ : The BGP peer status is not available.
--
-- * 'bpAsn' - The autonomous system (AS) number for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration.
--
-- * 'bpAuthKey' - The authentication key for BGP configuration. This string has a minimum length of 6 characters and and a maximun lenth of 80 characters.
--
-- * 'bpBgpPeerId' - The ID of the BGP peer.
--
-- * 'bpBgpPeerState' - The state of the BGP peer. The following are the possible values:     * @verifying@ : The BGP peering addresses or ASN require validation before the BGP peer can be created. This state applies only to public virtual interfaces.     * @pending@ : The BGP peer is created, and remains in this state until it is ready to be established.     * @available@ : The BGP peer is ready to be established.     * @deleting@ : The BGP peer is being deleted.     * @deleted@ : The BGP peer is deleted and cannot be established.
--
-- * 'bpAwsDeviceV2' - The Direct Connect endpoint on which the BGP peer terminates.
