-- | Creates a value of 'NewBGPPeer' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'nbpCustomerAddress' - The IP address assigned to the customer interface.
--
-- * 'nbpAmazonAddress' - The IP address assigned to the Amazon interface.
--
-- * 'nbpAddressFamily' - The address family for the BGP peer.
