-- | Creates a value of 'Interconnect' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iLagId' - The ID of the LAG.
--
-- * 'iInterconnectId' - The ID of the interconnect.
--
-- * 'iLocation' - The location of the connection.
--
-- * 'iInterconnectName' - The name of the interconnect.
--
-- * 'iAwsDevice' - The Direct Connect endpoint on which the physical connection terminates.
--
-- * 'iHasLogicalRedundancy' - Indicates whether the interconnect supports a secondary BGP in the same address family (IPv4/IPv6).
--
-- * 'iLoaIssueTime' - The time of the most recent call to 'DescribeLoa' for this connection.
--
-- * 'iBandwidth' - The bandwidth of the connection.
--
-- * 'iJumboFrameCapable' - Indicates whether jumbo frames (9001 MTU) are supported.
--
-- * 'iInterconnectState' - The state of the interconnect. The following are the possible values:     * @requested@ : The initial state of an interconnect. The interconnect stays in the requested state until the Letter of Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer.     * @pending@ : The interconnect is approved, and is being initialized.     * @available@ : The network link is up, and the interconnect is ready for use.     * @down@ : The network link is down.     * @deleting@ : The interconnect is being deleted.     * @deleted@ : The interconnect is deleted.     * @unknown@ : The state of the interconnect is not available.
--
-- * 'iRegion' - The AWS Region where the connection is located.
--
-- * 'iProviderName' - The name of the service provider associated with the interconnect.
--
-- * 'iAwsDeviceV2' - The Direct Connect endpoint on which the physical connection terminates.
--
-- * 'iTags' - The tags associated with the interconnect.
