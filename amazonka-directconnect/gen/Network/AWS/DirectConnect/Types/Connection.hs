-- | Creates a value of 'Connection' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cLagId' - The ID of the LAG.
--
-- * 'cVlan' - The ID of the VLAN.
--
-- * 'cLocation' - The location of the connection.
--
-- * 'cAwsDevice' - The Direct Connect endpoint on which the physical connection terminates.
--
-- * 'cHasLogicalRedundancy' - Indicates whether the connection supports a secondary BGP peer in the same address family (IPv4/IPv6).
--
-- * 'cConnectionId' - The ID of the connection.
--
-- * 'cLoaIssueTime' - The time of the most recent call to 'DescribeLoa' for this connection.
--
-- * 'cPartnerName' - The name of the AWS Direct Connect service provider associated with the connection.
--
-- * 'cConnectionName' - The name of the connection.
--
-- * 'cBandwidth' - The bandwidth of the connection.
--
-- * 'cJumboFrameCapable' - Indicates whether jumbo frames (9001 MTU) are supported.
--
-- * 'cOwnerAccount' - The ID of the AWS account that owns the connection.
--
-- * 'cRegion' - The AWS Region where the connection is located.
--
-- * 'cProviderName' - The name of the service provider associated with the connection.
--
-- * 'cAwsDeviceV2' - The Direct Connect endpoint on which the physical connection terminates.
--
-- * 'cConnectionState' - The state of the connection. The following are the possible values:     * @ordering@ : The initial state of a hosted connection provisioned on an interconnect. The connection stays in the ordering state until the owner of the hosted connection confirms or declines the connection order.     * @requested@ : The initial state of a standard connection. The connection stays in the requested state until the Letter of Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer.     * @pending@ : The connection has been approved and is being initialized.     * @available@ : The network link is up and the connection is ready for use.     * @down@ : The network link is down.     * @deleting@ : The connection is being deleted.     * @deleted@ : The connection has been deleted.     * @rejected@ : A hosted connection in the @ordering@ state enters the @rejected@ state if it is deleted by the customer.     * @unknown@ : The state of the connection is not available.
--
-- * 'cTags' - The tags associated with the connection.
