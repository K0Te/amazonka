-- | Creates a value of 'DirectConnectGateway' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dcgDirectConnectGatewayId' - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.
--
-- * 'dcgStateChangeError' - The error message if the state of an object failed to advance.
--
-- * 'dcgAmazonSideASN' - The autonomous system number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the connection.
--
-- * 'dcgDirectConnectGatewayName' - The name of the Direct Connect gateway.
--
-- * 'dcgDirectConnectGatewayState' - The state of the Direct Connect gateway. The following are the possible values:     * @pending@ : The initial state after calling 'CreateDirectConnectGateway' .     * @available@ : The Direct Connect gateway is ready for use.     * @deleting@ : The initial state after calling 'DeleteDirectConnectGateway' .     * @deleted@ : The Direct Connect gateway is deleted and cannot pass traffic.
