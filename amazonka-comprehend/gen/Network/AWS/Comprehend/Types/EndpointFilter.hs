-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'efStatus' - Specifies the status of the endpoint being returned. Possible values are: Creating, Ready, Updating, Deleting, Failed.
--
-- * 'efModelARN' - The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the endpoint is attached.
--
-- * 'efCreationTimeAfter' - Specifies a date after which the returned endpoint or endpoints were created.
--
-- * 'efCreationTimeBefore' - Specifies a date before which the returned endpoint or endpoints were created.
