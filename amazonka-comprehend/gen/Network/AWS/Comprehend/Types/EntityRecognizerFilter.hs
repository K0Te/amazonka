-- | Creates a value of 'EntityRecognizerFilter' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'erfStatus' - The status of an entity recognizer.
--
-- * 'erfSubmitTimeAfter' - Filters the list of entities based on the time that the list was submitted for processing. Returns only jobs submitted after the specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest to newest.
--
-- * 'erfSubmitTimeBefore' - Filters the list of entities based on the time that the list was submitted for processing. Returns only jobs submitted before the specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to oldest.
