-- | Creates a value of 'Entity' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eBeginOffset' - A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity begins (the first character is at position 0). The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A /code point/ is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.
--
-- * 'eText' - The text of the entity.
--
-- * 'eScore' - The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection.
--
-- * 'eEndOffset' - A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity ends. The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A /code point/ is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point. 
--
-- * 'eType' - The entity's type.
