-- | Creates a value of 'PiiEntity' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'peBeginOffset' - A character offset in the input text that shows where the PII entity begins (the first character is at position 0). The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A /code point/ is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.
--
-- * 'peScore' - The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection.
--
-- * 'peEndOffset' - A character offset in the input text that shows where the PII entity ends. The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A /code point/ is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.
--
-- * 'peType' - The entity's type.
