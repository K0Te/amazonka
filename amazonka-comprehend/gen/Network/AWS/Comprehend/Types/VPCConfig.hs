--
-- * 'vcSecurityGroupIds' - The ID number for a security group on an instance of your private VPC. Security groups on your VPC function serve as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic and provides security for the resources that you’ll be accessing on the VPC. This ID number is preceded by "sg-", for instance: "sg-03b388029b0a285ea". For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html Security Groups for your VPC> . 
--
-- * 'vcSubnets' - The ID for each subnet being used in your private VPC. This subnet is a subset of the a range of IPv4 addresses used by the VPC and is specific to a given availability zone in the VPC’s region. This ID number is preceded by "subnet-", for instance: "subnet-04ccf456919e69055". For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html VPCs and Subnets> .
