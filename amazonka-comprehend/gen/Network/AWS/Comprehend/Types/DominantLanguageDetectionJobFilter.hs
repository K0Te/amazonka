-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dldjfSubmitTimeAfter' - Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was submitted for processing. Returns only jobs submitted after the specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to oldest.
--
-- * 'dldjfSubmitTimeBefore' - Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was submitted for processing. Returns only jobs submitted before the specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest to newest.
--
-- * 'dldjfJobName' - Filters on the name of the job.
--
-- * 'dldjfJobStatus' - Filters the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only jobs with the specified status.
