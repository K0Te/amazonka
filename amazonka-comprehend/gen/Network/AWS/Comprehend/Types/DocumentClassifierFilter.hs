-- | Creates a value of 'DocumentClassifierFilter' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dcfStatus' - Filters the list of classifiers based on status.
--
-- * 'dcfSubmitTimeAfter' - Filters the list of classifiers based on the time that the classifier was submitted for processing. Returns only classifiers submitted after the specified time. Classifiers are returned in descending order, newest to oldest.
--
-- * 'dcfSubmitTimeBefore' - Filters the list of classifiers based on the time that the classifier was submitted for processing. Returns only classifiers submitted before the specified time. Classifiers are returned in ascending order, oldest to newest.
