-- | Creates a value of 'InsightImpactGraphService' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iigsReferenceId' - Identifier for the service. Unique within the service map.
--
-- * 'iigsAccountId' - Identifier of the AWS account in which the service runs.
--
-- * 'iigsNames' - A list of names for the service, including the canonical name.
--
-- * 'iigsName' - The canonical name of the service.
--
-- * 'iigsType' - Identifier for the service. Unique within the service map.     * AWS Resource - The type of an AWS resource. For example, AWS::EC2::Instance for an application running on Amazon EC2 or AWS::DynamoDB::Table for an Amazon DynamoDB table that the application used.      * AWS Service - The type of an AWS service. For example, AWS::DynamoDB for downstream calls to Amazon DynamoDB that didn't target a specific table.      * AWS Service - The type of an AWS service. For example, AWS::DynamoDB for downstream calls to Amazon DynamoDB that didn't target a specific table.      * remote - A downstream service of indeterminate type.
--
-- * 'iigsEdges' - Connections to downstream services.
