-- | Creates a value of 'ServiceInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sState' - The service's state.
--
-- * 'sStartTime' - The start time of the first segment that the service generated.
--
-- * 'sRoot' - Indicates that the service was the first service to process a request.
--
-- * 'sResponseTimeHistogram' - A histogram that maps the spread of service response times.
--
-- * 'sDurationHistogram' - A histogram that maps the spread of service durations.
--
-- * 'sReferenceId' - Identifier for the service. Unique within the service map.
--
-- * 'sAccountId' - Identifier of the AWS account in which the service runs.
--
-- * 'sNames' - A list of names for the service, including the canonical name.
--
-- * 'sName' - The canonical name of the service.
--
-- * 'sEndTime' - The end time of the last segment that the service generated.
--
-- * 'sType' - The type of service.     * AWS Resource - The type of an AWS resource. For example, @AWS::EC2::Instance@ for an application running on Amazon EC2 or @AWS::DynamoDB::Table@ for an Amazon DynamoDB table that the application used.     * AWS Service - The type of an AWS service. For example, @AWS::DynamoDB@ for downstream calls to Amazon DynamoDB that didn't target a specific table.     * @client@ - Represents the clients that sent requests to a root service.     * @remote@ - A downstream service of indeterminate type.
--
-- * 'sEdges' - Connections to downstream services.
--
-- * 'sSummaryStatistics' - Aggregated statistics for the service.
