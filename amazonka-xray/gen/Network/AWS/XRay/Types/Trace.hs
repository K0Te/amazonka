-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tLimitExceeded' - LimitExceeded is set to true when the trace has exceeded one of the defined quotas. For more information about quotas, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xray.html AWS X-Ray endpoints and quotas> .
--
-- * 'tId' - The unique identifier for the request that generated the trace's segments and subsegments.
--
-- * 'tSegments' - Segment documents for the segments and subsegments that comprise the trace.
--
-- * 'tDuration' - The length of time in seconds between the start time of the root segment and the end time of the last segment that completed.
