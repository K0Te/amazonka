-- | Creates a value of 'InsightSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'isSummary' - A brief description of the insight.
--
-- * 'isState' - The current state of the insight.
--
-- * 'isStartTime' - The time, in Unix seconds, at which the insight began.
--
-- * 'isInsightId' - The insights unique identifier. 
--
-- * 'isCategories' - Categories The categories that label and describe the type of insight.
--
-- * 'isRootCauseServiceRequestImpactStatistics' - The impact statistics of the root cause service. This includes the number of requests to the client service and whether the requests were faults or okay. 
--
-- * 'isTopAnomalousServices' - The service within the insight that is most impacted by the incident.
--
-- * 'isRootCauseServiceId' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'isClientRequestImpactStatistics' - The impact statistics of the client side service. This includes the number of requests to the client service and whether the requests were faults or okay. 
--
-- * 'isEndTime' - The time, in Unix seconds, at which the insight ended.
--
-- * 'isGroupARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group that the insight belongs to.
--
-- * 'isGroupName' - The name of the group that the insight belongs to.
--
-- * 'isLastUpdateTime' - The time, in Unix seconds, that the insight was last updated.
