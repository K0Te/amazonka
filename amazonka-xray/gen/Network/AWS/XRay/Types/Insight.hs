-- | Creates a value of 'Insight' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iSummary' - A brief description of the insight.
--
-- * 'iState' - The current state of the insight.
--
-- * 'iStartTime' - The time, in Unix seconds, at which the insight began.
--
-- * 'iInsightId' - The insights unique identifier. 
--
-- * 'iCategories' - The categories that label and describe the type of insight.
--
-- * 'iRootCauseServiceRequestImpactStatistics' - The impact statistics of the root cause service. This includes the number of requests to the client service and whether the requests were faults or okay.
--
-- * 'iTopAnomalousServices' - The service within the insight that is most impacted by the incident.
--
-- * 'iRootCauseServiceId' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'iClientRequestImpactStatistics' - The impact statistics of the client side service. This includes the number of requests to the client service and whether the requests were faults or okay.
