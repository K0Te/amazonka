-- | Creates a value of 'SamplingTargetDocument' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'stdReservoirQuota' - The number of requests per second that X-Ray allocated for this service.
--
-- * 'stdRuleName' - The name of the sampling rule.
--
-- * 'stdFixedRate' - The percentage of matching requests to instrument, after the reservoir is exhausted.
--
-- * 'stdInterval' - The number of seconds for the service to wait before getting sampling targets again.
--
-- * 'stdReservoirQuotaTTL' - When the reservoir quota expires.
