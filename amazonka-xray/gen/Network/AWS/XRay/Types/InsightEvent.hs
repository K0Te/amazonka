-- | Creates a value of 'InsightEvent' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ieSummary' - A brief description of the event.
--
-- * 'ieEventTime' - The time, in Unix seconds, at which the event was recorded.
--
-- * 'ieRootCauseServiceRequestImpactStatistics' - The impact statistics of the root cause service. This includes the number of requests to the client service and whether the requests were faults or okay.
--
-- * 'ieTopAnomalousServices' - The service during the event that is most impacted by the incident.
--
-- * 'ieClientRequestImpactStatistics' - The impact statistics of the client side service. This includes the number of requests to the client service and whether the requests were faults or okay.
