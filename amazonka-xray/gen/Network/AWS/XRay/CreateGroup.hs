-- | Creates a value of 'CreateGroup' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cgFilterExpression' - The filter expression defining criteria by which to group traces.
--
-- * 'cgInsightsConfiguration' - The structure containing configurations related to insights.     * The InsightsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable insights for the new group or false to disable insights for the new group.     * The NotifcationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable insights notifications for the new group. Notifications may only be enabled on a group with InsightsEnabled set to true.
--
-- * 'cgTags' - A map that contains one or more tag keys and tag values to attach to an X-Ray group. For more information about ways to use tags, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html Tagging AWS resources> in the /AWS General Reference/ . The following restrictions apply to tags:     * Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50     * Maximum tag key length: 128 Unicode characters     * Maximum tag value length: 256 Unicode characters     * Valid values for key and value: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, space, and the following characters: _ . : / = + - and @     * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.     * Don't use @aws:@ as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for AWS use.
--
-- * 'cgGroupName' - The case-sensitive name of the new group. Default is a reserved name and names must be unique.
