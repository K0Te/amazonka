-- | Creates a value of 'DialogAction' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'daSlots' - Map of the slots that have been gathered and their values. 
--
-- * 'daIntentName' - The name of the intent.
--
-- * 'daFulfillmentState' - The fulfillment state of the intent. The possible values are:     * @Failed@ - The Lambda function associated with the intent failed to fulfill the intent.     * @Fulfilled@ - The intent has fulfilled by the Lambda function associated with the intent.      * @ReadyForFulfillment@ - All of the information necessary for the intent is present and the intent ready to be fulfilled by the client application.
--
-- * 'daMessageFormat' -     * @PlainText@ - The message contains plain UTF-8 text.     * @CustomPayload@ - The message is a custom format for the client.     * @SSML@ - The message contains text formatted for voice output.     * @Composite@ - The message contains an escaped JSON object containing one or more messages. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/howitworks-manage-prompts.html Message Groups> . 
--
-- * 'daMessage' - The message that should be shown to the user. If you don't specify a message, Amazon Lex will use the message configured for the intent.
--
-- * 'daSlotToElicit' - The name of the slot that should be elicited from the user.
--
-- * 'daType' - The next action that the bot should take in its interaction with the user. The possible values are:     * @ConfirmIntent@ - The next action is asking the user if the intent is complete and ready to be fulfilled. This is a yes/no question such as "Place the order?"     * @Close@ - Indicates that the there will not be a response from the user. For example, the statement "Your order has been placed" does not require a response.     * @Delegate@ - The next action is determined by Amazon Lex.     * @ElicitIntent@ - The next action is to determine the intent that the user wants to fulfill.     * @ElicitSlot@ - The next action is to elicit a slot value from the user.
