-- | Creates a value of 'IntentSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'isCheckpointLabel' - A user-defined label that identifies a particular intent. You can use this label to return to a previous intent.  Use the @checkpointLabelFilter@ parameter of the @GetSessionRequest@ operation to filter the intents returned by the operation to those with only the specified label.
--
-- * 'isSlots' - Map of the slots that have been gathered and their values. 
--
-- * 'isIntentName' - The name of the intent.
--
-- * 'isFulfillmentState' - The fulfillment state of the intent. The possible values are:     * @Failed@ - The Lambda function associated with the intent failed to fulfill the intent.     * @Fulfilled@ - The intent has fulfilled by the Lambda function associated with the intent.      * @ReadyForFulfillment@ - All of the information necessary for the intent is present and the intent ready to be fulfilled by the client application.
--
-- * 'isConfirmationStatus' - The status of the intent after the user responds to the confirmation prompt. If the user confirms the intent, Amazon Lex sets this field to @Confirmed@ . If the user denies the intent, Amazon Lex sets this value to @Denied@ . The possible values are:     * @Confirmed@ - The user has responded "Yes" to the confirmation prompt, confirming that the intent is complete and that it is ready to be fulfilled.     * @Denied@ - The user has responded "No" to the confirmation prompt.     * @None@ - The user has never been prompted for confirmation; or, the user was prompted but did not confirm or deny the prompt.
--
-- * 'isSlotToElicit' - The next slot to elicit from the user. If there is not slot to elicit, the field is blank.
--
-- * 'isDialogActionType' - The next action that the bot should take in its interaction with the user. The possible values are:     * @ConfirmIntent@ - The next action is asking the user if the intent is complete and ready to be fulfilled. This is a yes/no question such as "Place the order?"     * @Close@ - Indicates that the there will not be a response from the user. For example, the statement "Your order has been placed" does not require a response.     * @ElicitIntent@ - The next action is to determine the intent that the user wants to fulfill.     * @ElicitSlot@ - The next action is to elicit a slot value from the user.
