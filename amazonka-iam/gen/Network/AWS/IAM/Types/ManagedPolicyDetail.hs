-- | Creates a value of 'ManagedPolicyDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mpdPolicyName' - The friendly name (not ARN) identifying the policy.
--
-- * 'mpdARN' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'mpdUpdateDate' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when the policy was last updated. When a policy has only one version, this field contains the date and time when the policy was created. When a policy has more than one version, this field contains the date and time when the most recent policy version was created.
--
-- * 'mpdPolicyId' - The stable and unique string identifying the policy. For more information about IDs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'mpdPath' - The path to the policy. For more information about paths, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ .

--
-- * 'mpdIsAttachable' - Specifies whether the policy can be attached to an IAM user, group, or role.
--
-- * 'mpdPermissionsBoundaryUsageCount' - The number of entities (users and roles) for which the policy is used as the permissions boundary.  For more information about permissions boundaries, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html Permissions Boundaries for IAM Identities > in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
