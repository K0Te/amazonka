-- | Creates a value of 'User' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'uPasswordLastUsed' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an AWS website. For a list of AWS websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html Credential Reports> topic in the /IAM User Guide/ . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:     * The user never had a password.     * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. A null value does not mean that the user /never/ had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used. This value is returned only in the 'GetUser' and 'ListUsers' operations. 
--
-- * 'uPermissionsBoundary' - The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user. For more information about permissions boundaries, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html Permissions Boundaries for IAM Identities > in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'uTags' - A list of tags that are associated with the specified user. For more information about tagging, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html Tagging IAM Identities> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'uPath' - The path to the user. For more information about paths, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'uUserName' - The friendly name identifying the user.
--
-- * 'uUserId' - The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'uARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ . 
--
-- * 'uCreateDate' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when the user was created.
