-- | Creates a value of 'Policy' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pPolicyName' - The friendly name (not ARN) identifying the policy.
--
-- * 'pARN' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'pUpdateDate' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when the policy was last updated. When a policy has only one version, this field contains the date and time when the policy was created. When a policy has more than one version, this field contains the date and time when the most recent policy version was created.
--
-- * 'pPolicyId' - The stable and unique string identifying the policy. For more information about IDs, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'pPath' - The path to the policy. For more information about paths, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'pCreateDate' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when the policy was created.
--
-- * 'pIsAttachable' - Specifies whether the policy can be attached to an IAM user, group, or role.
--
-- * 'pPermissionsBoundaryUsageCount' - The number of entities (users and roles) for which the policy is used to set the permissions boundary.  For more information about permissions boundaries, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html Permissions Boundaries for IAM Identities > in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'pDefaultVersionId' - The identifier for the version of the policy that is set as the default version.
--
-- * 'pAttachmentCount' - The number of entities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to.
--
-- * 'pDescription' - A friendly description of the policy. This element is included in the response to the 'GetPolicy' operation. It is not included in the response to the 'ListPolicies' operation.
