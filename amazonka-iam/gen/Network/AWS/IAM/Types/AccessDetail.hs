-- | Creates a value of 'AccessDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'adEntityPath' - The path of the Organizations entity (root, organizational unit, or account) from which an authenticated principal last attempted to access the service. AWS does not report unauthenticated requests. This field is null if no principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or root users) in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> .
--
-- * 'adRegion' - The Region where the last service access attempt occurred. This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> .
--
-- * 'adLastAuthenticatedTime' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when an authenticated principal most recently attempted to access the service. AWS does not report unauthenticated requests. This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> .
--
-- * 'adTotalAuthenticatedEntities' - The number of accounts with authenticated principals (root users, IAM users, and IAM roles) that attempted to access the service in the reporting period.
--
-- * 'adServiceName' - The name of the service in which access was attempted.
--
-- * 'adServiceNamespace' - The namespace of the service in which access was attempted. To learn the service namespace of a service, go to <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services> in the /IAM User Guide/ . Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, @(service prefix: a4b)@ .
