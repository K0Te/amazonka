-- | Creates a value of 'ServiceLastAccessed' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'slaLastAuthenticated' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when an authenticated entity most recently attempted to access the service. AWS does not report unauthenticated requests. This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to access the service within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> .
--
-- * 'slaTrackedActionsLastAccessed' - An object that contains details about the most recent attempt to access a tracked action within the service. This field is null if there no tracked actions or if the principal did not use the tracked actions within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> . This field is also null if the report was generated at the service level and not the action level. For more information, see the @Granularity@ field in 'GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails' .
--
-- * 'slaLastAuthenticatedEntity' - The ARN of the authenticated entity (user or role) that last attempted to access the service. AWS does not report unauthenticated requests. This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to access the service within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> .
--
-- * 'slaLastAuthenticatedRegion' - The Region from which the authenticated entity (user or role) last attempted to access the service. AWS does not report unauthenticated requests. This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to access the service within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> .
--
-- * 'slaTotalAuthenticatedEntities' - The total number of authenticated principals (root user, IAM users, or IAM roles) that have attempted to access the service. This field is null if no principals attempted to access the service within the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period reporting period> .
--
-- * 'slaServiceName' - The name of the service in which access was attempted.
--
-- * 'slaServiceNamespace' - The namespace of the service in which access was attempted. To learn the service namespace of a service, go to <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services> in the /IAM User Guide/ . Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, @(service prefix: a4b)@ .
