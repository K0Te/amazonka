-- | Creates a value of 'PolicyVersion' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pvVersionId' - The identifier for the policy version. Policy version identifiers always begin with @v@ (always lowercase). When a policy is created, the first policy version is @v1@ . 
--
-- * 'pvCreateDate' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when the policy version was created.
--
-- * 'pvDocument' - The policy document. The policy document is returned in the response to the 'GetPolicyVersion' and 'GetAccountAuthorizationDetails' operations. It is not returned in the response to the 'CreatePolicyVersion' or 'ListPolicyVersions' operations.  The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 RFC 3986> . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the @decode@ method of the @java.net.URLDecoder@ utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.
--
-- * 'pvIsDefaultVersion' - Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's default version.
