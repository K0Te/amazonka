-- | Creates a value of 'AccessKeyLastUsed' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'akluLastUsedDate' - The date and time, in <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 date-time format> , when the access key was most recently used. This field is null in the following situations:     * The user does not have an access key.     * An access key exists but has not been used since IAM began tracking this information.     * There is no sign-in data associated with the user.
--
-- * 'akluServiceName' - The name of the AWS service with which this access key was most recently used. The value of this field is "N/A" in the following situations:     * The user does not have an access key.     * An access key exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information.     * There is no sign-in data associated with the user.
--
-- * 'akluRegion' - The AWS Region where this access key was most recently used. The value for this field is "N/A" in the following situations:     * The user does not have an access key.     * An access key exists but has not been used since IAM began tracking this information.     * There is no sign-in data associated with the user.
