-- Generates a report that includes details about when an IAM resource (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an attempt to access AWS services. Recent activity usually appears within four hours. IAM reports activity for the last 365 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period Regions Where Data Is Tracked> .
--
--
-- /Important:/ The service last accessed data includes all attempts to access an AWS API, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the AWS Management Console, the AWS API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html Logging IAM Events with CloudTrail> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- The @GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails@ operation returns a @JobId@ . Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report: 
--
--     * 'GetServiceLastAccessedDetails' – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every AWS service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt.
--
-- The @JobId@ returned by @GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail@ must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call @GetServiceLastAccessedDetail@ .
--
--     * 'GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities' – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific AWS service. 
--
--
--
-- To check the status of the @GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails@ request, use the @JobId@ parameter in the same operations and test the @JobStatus@ response parameter.
--
-- For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the 'ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess' operation.
--
-- For more information about service and action last accessed data, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html Reducing Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data> in the /IAM User Guide/ .

If you don't include this optional parameter, the operation generates service data.
