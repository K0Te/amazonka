-- | Creates a value of 'CreateUser' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cuPath' - The path for the user name. For more information about paths, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html IAM Identifiers> in the /IAM User Guide/ . This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (@\u0021@ ) through the DEL character (@\u007F@ ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
--
-- * 'cuPermissionsBoundary' - The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user.
--
-- * 'cuTags' - A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created user. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html Tagging IAM Identities> in the /IAM User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cuUserName' - The name of the user to create. IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".
