-- Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players. Before players can be added, a game session must have an @ACTIVE@ status, have a creation policy of @ALLOW_ALL@ , and have an open player slot. To add a single player to a game session, use 'CreatePlayerSession' . When a player connects to the game server and references a player session ID, the game server contacts the Amazon GameLift service to validate the player reservation and accept the player.
--
--
-- To create player sessions, specify a game session ID, a list of player IDs, and optionally a set of player data strings. If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each player and a set of new 'PlayerSession' objects is returned. Player sessions cannot be updated.
