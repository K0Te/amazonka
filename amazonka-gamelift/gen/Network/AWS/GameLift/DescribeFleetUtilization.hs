-- Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. These statistics provide insight into how available hosting resources are currently being used. To get statistics on available hosting resources, see 'DescribeFleetCapacity' .
--
--
-- You can request utilization data for all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet IDs. When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a 'FleetUtilization' object is returned for each requested fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found.

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeFleetUtilization' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dfuNextToken' - Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.
--
-- * 'dfuLimit' - The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with @NextToken@ to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.
--
-- * 'dfuFleetIds' - A unique identifier for a fleet(s) to retrieve utilization data for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes for all current fleets, do not include this parameter. If the list of fleet identifiers includes fleets that don't currently exist, the request succeeds but no attributes for that fleet are returned.
