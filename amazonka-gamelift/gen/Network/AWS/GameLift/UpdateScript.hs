-- Updates Realtime script metadata and content.
--
--
-- To update script metadata, specify the script ID and provide updated name and/or version values. 
--
-- To update script content, provide an updated zip file by pointing to either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You can use either method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the /Version/ parameter to track updates to the script.
--
-- If the call is successful, the updated metadata is stored in the script record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift service. Once the script is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new version is used for all new game sessions.

-- | Creates a value of 'UpdateScript' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'usStorageLocation' - The Amazon S3 location of your Realtime scripts. The storage location must specify the S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and an IAM role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the script you're updating. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the @ObjectVersion@ parameter to specify an earlier version. To call this operation with a storage location, you must have IAM PassRole permission. For more details on IAM roles and PassRole permissions, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/setting-up-role.html Set up a role for GameLift access> . 
--
-- * 'usZipFile' - A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB. When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: @--zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip@ .-- /Note:/ This 'Lens' automatically encodes and decodes Base64 data. The underlying isomorphism will encode to Base64 representation during serialisation, and decode from Base64 representation during deserialisation. This 'Lens' accepts and returns only raw unencoded data.
--
-- * 'usName' - A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need to be unique.
--
-- * 'usVersion' - The version that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique.
--
-- * 'usScriptId' - A unique identifier for a Realtime script to update. You can use either the script ID or ARN value.
