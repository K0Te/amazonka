-- Retrieves the current capacity statistics for one or more fleets. These statistics present a snapshot of the fleet's instances and provide insight on current or imminent scaling activity. To get statistics on game hosting activity in the fleet, see 'DescribeFleetUtilization' .
--
--
-- You can request capacity for all fleets or specify a list of one or more fleet identifiers. When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a 'FleetCapacity' object is returned for each requested fleet ID. When a list of fleet IDs is provided, attribute objects are returned only for fleets that currently exist.
