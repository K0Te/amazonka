-- Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether your are using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're also using GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests ('StartMatchmaking' or 'StartMatchBackfill' ) identify the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with that configuration. 
--
--
-- To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when starting a game session for the match.
--
-- In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive matchmaking notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. An alternative method, continuously polling ticket status with 'DescribeMatchmaking' , is only suitable for games in development with low matchmaking usage.

-- | Creates a value of 'CreateMatchmakingConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cmcBackfillMode' - The method used to backfill game sessions that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Specify @MANUAL@ when your game manages backfill requests manually or does not use the match backfill feature. Specify @AUTOMATIC@ to have GameLift create a 'StartMatchBackfill' request whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about manual and automatic backfill in <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch> . Automatic backfill is not available when @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ .
--
-- * 'cmcGameProperties' - A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key-value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the 'GameSession' object with a request to start a new game session (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession Start a Game Session> ). This information is added to the new 'GameSession' object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used if @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ .
--
-- * 'cmcAcceptanceTimeoutSeconds' - The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the tickets are returned to the ticket pool and continue to be evaluated for an acceptable match.
--
-- * 'cmcNotificationTarget' - An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications.
--
-- * 'cmcFlexMatchMode' - Indicates whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution.      * __STANDALONE__ - FlexMatch forms matches and returns match information, including players and team assignments, in a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html#match-events-matchmakingsucceeded MatchmakingSucceeded> event.     * __WITH_QUEUE__ - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified GameLift queue to start a game session for the match. 
--
-- * 'cmcGameSessionQueueARNs' - Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start new GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. If @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ , do not set this parameter. 
--
-- * 'cmcCustomEventData' - Information to be added to all events related to this matchmaking configuration. 
--
-- * 'cmcGameSessionData' - A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the 'GameSession' object with a request to start a new game session (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession Start a Game Session> ). This information is added to the new 'GameSession' object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used if @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ .
--
-- * 'cmcDescription' - A human-readable description of the matchmaking configuration. 
--
-- * 'cmcTags' - A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html Tagging AWS Resources> in the /AWS General Reference/ . Once the resource is created, you can use 'TagResource' , 'UntagResource' , and 'ListTagsForResource' to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.
--
-- * 'cmcAdditionalPlayerCount' - The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, assume that the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team. If the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are initially selected for the match. This parameter is not used if @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ .
--
-- * 'cmcName' - A unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration. This name is used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.
--
-- * 'cmcRequestTimeoutSeconds' - The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.
--
-- * 'cmcAcceptanceRequired' - A flag that determines whether a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to @TRUE@ . With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status @REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE@ to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance. 
--
-- * 'cmcRuleSetName' - A unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.

If @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ , do not set this parameter. 
cmcGameSessionQueueARNs :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration [Text]
cmcGameSessionQueueARNs = lens _cmcGameSessionQueueARNs (\ s a -> s{_cmcGameSessionQueueARNs = a}) . _Default . _Coerce

-- | Information to be added to all events related to this matchmaking configuration. 
cmcCustomEventData :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration (Maybe Text)
cmcCustomEventData = lens _cmcCustomEventData (\ s a -> s{_cmcCustomEventData = a})

-- | A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the 'GameSession' object with a request to start a new game session (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession Start a Game Session> ). This information is added to the new 'GameSession' object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used if @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ .
cmcGameSessionData :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration (Maybe Text)
cmcGameSessionData = lens _cmcGameSessionData (\ s a -> s{_cmcGameSessionData = a})

-- | A human-readable description of the matchmaking configuration. 
cmcDescription :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration (Maybe Text)
cmcDescription = lens _cmcDescription (\ s a -> s{_cmcDescription = a})

-- | A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html Tagging AWS Resources> in the /AWS General Reference/ . Once the resource is created, you can use 'TagResource' , 'UntagResource' , and 'ListTagsForResource' to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.
cmcTags :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration [Tag]
cmcTags = lens _cmcTags (\ s a -> s{_cmcTags = a}) . _Default . _Coerce

-- | The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, assume that the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team. If the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are initially selected for the match. This parameter is not used if @FlexMatchMode@ is set to @STANDALONE@ .
cmcAdditionalPlayerCount :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration (Maybe Natural)
cmcAdditionalPlayerCount = lens _cmcAdditionalPlayerCount (\ s a -> s{_cmcAdditionalPlayerCount = a}) . mapping _Nat

-- | A unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration. This name is used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.
cmcName :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration Text
cmcName = lens _cmcName (\ s a -> s{_cmcName = a})

-- | The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.
cmcRequestTimeoutSeconds :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration Natural
cmcRequestTimeoutSeconds = lens _cmcRequestTimeoutSeconds (\ s a -> s{_cmcRequestTimeoutSeconds = a}) . _Nat

-- | A flag that determines whether a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to @TRUE@ . With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status @REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE@ to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance. 
cmcAcceptanceRequired :: Lens' CreateMatchmakingConfiguration Bool
cmcAcceptanceRequired = lens _cmcAcceptanceRequired (\ s a -> s{_cmcAcceptanceRequired = a})

-- | A unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.
