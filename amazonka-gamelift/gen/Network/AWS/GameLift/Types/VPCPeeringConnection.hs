-- | Creates a value of 'VPCPeeringConnection' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'vpcVPCPeeringConnectionId' - A unique identifier that is automatically assigned to the connection record. This ID is referenced in VPC peering connection events, and is used when deleting a connection with 'DeleteVpcPeeringConnection' . 
--
-- * 'vpcStatus' - The status information about the connection. Status indicates if a connection is pending, successful, or failed.
--
-- * 'vpcPeerVPCId' - A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region where your fleet is deployed. Look up a VPC ID using the <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ VPC Dashboard> in the AWS Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets> .
--
-- * 'vpcFleetARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) associated with the GameLift fleet resource for this connection. 
--
-- * 'vpcIPV4CidrBlock' - CIDR block of IPv4 addresses assigned to the VPC peering connection for the GameLift VPC. The peered VPC also has an IPv4 CIDR block associated with it; these blocks cannot overlap or the peering connection cannot be created. 
--
-- * 'vpcGameLiftVPCId' - A unique identifier for the VPC that contains the Amazon GameLift fleet for this connection. This VPC is managed by Amazon GameLift and does not appear in your AWS account. 
--
-- * 'vpcFleetId' - A unique identifier for a fleet. This ID determines the ID of the Amazon GameLift VPC for your fleet.
