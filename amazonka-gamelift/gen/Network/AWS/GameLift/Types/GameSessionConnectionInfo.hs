-- | Connection information for a new game session that is created in response to a 'StartMatchmaking' request. Once a match is made, the FlexMatch engine creates a new game session for it. This information, including the game session endpoint and player sessions for each player in the original matchmaking request, is added to the 'MatchmakingTicket' , which can be retrieved by calling 'DescribeMatchmaking' .

-- | Creates a value of 'GameSessionConnectionInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gsciMatchedPlayerSessions' - A collection of player session IDs, one for each player ID that was included in the original matchmaking request. 
--
-- * 'gsciIPAddress' - IP address of the instance that is running the game session. When connecting to a Amazon GameLift game server, a client needs to reference an IP address (or DNS name) and port number.
--
-- * 'gsciGameSessionARN' - Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a game session and uniquely identifies it.
--
-- * 'gsciDNSName' - DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:     * TLS-enabled fleets: @<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com@ .     * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: @ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com@ . (See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing> .) When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.
--
-- * 'gsciPort' - Port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.
