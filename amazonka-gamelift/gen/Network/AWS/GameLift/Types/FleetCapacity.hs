--
-- * 'fcInstanceType' - Name of an EC2 instance type that is supported in Amazon GameLift. A fleet instance type determines the computing resources of each instance in the fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. Amazon GameLift supports the following EC2 instance types. See <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ Amazon EC2 Instance Types> for detailed descriptions.
--
-- * 'fcFleetId' - A unique identifier for a fleet.
--
-- * 'fcInstanceCounts' - Current status of fleet capacity.
