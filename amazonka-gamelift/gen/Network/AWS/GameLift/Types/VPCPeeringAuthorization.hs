-- | Creates a value of 'VPCPeeringAuthorization' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'vpaCreationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this authorization was issued. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'vpaPeerVPCId' - A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region where your fleet is deployed. Look up a VPC ID using the <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ VPC Dashboard> in the AWS Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets> .

-- * 'vpaPeerVPCAWSAccountId' - 
--
-- * 'vpaGameLiftAWSAccountId' - A unique identifier for the AWS account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleet. You can find your Account ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.
--
-- * 'vpaExpirationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this authorization expires (24 hours after issuance). Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
