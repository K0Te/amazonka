-- | Creates a value of 'FleetAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'faCreationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'faStatus' - Current status of the fleet. Possible fleet statuses include the following:     * __NEW__ -- A new fleet has been defined and desired instances is set to 1.      * __DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING/ACTIVATING__ -- Amazon GameLift is setting up the new fleet, creating new instances with the game build or Realtime script and starting server processes.     * __ACTIVE__ -- Hosts can now accept game sessions.     * __ERROR__ -- An error occurred when downloading, validating, building, or activating the fleet.     * __DELETING__ -- Hosts are responding to a delete fleet request.     * __TERMINATED__ -- The fleet no longer exists.
--
-- * 'faServerLaunchParameters' - Game server launch parameters specified for fleets created before 2016-08-04 (or AWS SDK v. 0.12.16). Server launch parameters for fleets created after this date are specified in the fleet's 'RuntimeConfiguration' .
--
-- * 'faLogPaths' - Location of default log files. When a server process is shut down, Amazon GameLift captures and stores any log files in this location. These logs are in addition to game session logs; see more on game session logs in the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-api-server-code Amazon GameLift Developer Guide> . If no default log path for a fleet is specified, Amazon GameLift automatically uploads logs that are stored on each instance at @C:\game\logs@ (for Windows) or @/local/game/logs@ (for Linux). Use the Amazon GameLift console to access stored logs. 
--
-- * 'faOperatingSystem' - Operating system of the fleet's computing resources. A fleet's operating system depends on the OS specified for the build that is deployed on this fleet.
--
-- * 'faBuildId' - A unique identifier for a build.
--
-- * 'faFleetARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. In a GameLift fleet ARN, the resource ID matches the /FleetId/ value.
--
-- * 'faFleetType' - Indicates whether the fleet uses on-demand or spot instances. A spot instance in use may be interrupted with a two-minute notification.
--
-- * 'faTerminationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'faInstanceType' - EC2 instance type indicating the computing resources of each instance in the fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. See <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ Amazon EC2 Instance Types> for detailed descriptions.
--
-- * 'faStoppedActions' - List of fleet activity that have been suspended using 'StopFleetActions' . This includes auto-scaling.
--
-- * 'faNewGameSessionProtectionPolicy' - The type of game session protection to set for all new instances started in the fleet.     * __NoProtection__ -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event.     * __FullProtection__ -- If the game session is in an @ACTIVE@ status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
--
-- * 'faName' - A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique.
--
-- * 'faScriptId' - A unique identifier for a Realtime script.
--
-- * 'faScriptARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) associated with the GameLift script resource that is deployed on instances in this fleet. In a GameLift script ARN, the resource ID matches the /ScriptId/ value.
--
-- * 'faCertificateConfiguration' - Indicates whether a TLS/SSL certificate was generated for the fleet. 
--
-- * 'faServerLaunchPath' - Path to a game server executable in the fleet's build, specified for fleets created before 2016-08-04 (or AWS SDK v. 0.12.16). Server launch paths for fleets created after this date are specified in the fleet's 'RuntimeConfiguration' .
--
-- * 'faInstanceRoleARN' - A unique identifier for an AWS IAM role that manages access to your AWS services.
--
-- * 'faMetricGroups' - Names of metric groups that this fleet is included in. In Amazon CloudWatch, you can view metrics for an individual fleet or aggregated metrics for fleets that are in a fleet metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time.
--
-- * 'faBuildARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) associated with the GameLift build resource that is deployed on instances in this fleet. In a GameLift build ARN, the resource ID matches the /BuildId/ value.
--
-- * 'faFleetId' - A unique identifier for a fleet.
--
-- * 'faDescription' - Human-readable description of the fleet.
--
-- * 'faResourceCreationLimitPolicy' - Fleet policy to limit the number of game sessions an individual player can create over a span of time.
