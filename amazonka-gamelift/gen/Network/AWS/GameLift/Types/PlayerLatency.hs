-- | Regional latency information for a player, used when requesting a new game session with 'StartGameSessionPlacement' . This value indicates the amount of time lag that exists when the player is connected to a fleet in the specified Region. The relative difference between a player's latency values for multiple Regions are used to determine which fleets are best suited to place a new game session for the player.
