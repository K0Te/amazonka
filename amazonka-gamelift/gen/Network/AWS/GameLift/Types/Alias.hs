-- | Creates a value of 'Alias' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aCreationTime' - A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'aLastUpdatedTime' - The time that this data object was last modified. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'aAliasId' - A unique identifier for an alias. Alias IDs are unique within a Region.
--
-- * 'aRoutingStrategy' - The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet target, for the alias. 
--
-- * 'aName' - A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do not need to be unique.
--
-- * 'aAliasARN' - Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a GameLift alias resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. In a GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias ID value.
--
-- * 'aDescription' - A human-readable description of an alias.
