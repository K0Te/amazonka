-- | Creates a value of 'Instance' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iCreationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'iInstanceId' - A unique identifier for an instance.
--
-- * 'iStatus' - Current status of the instance. Possible statuses include the following:     * __PENDING__ -- The instance is in the process of being created and launching server processes as defined in the fleet's run-time configuration.      * __ACTIVE__ -- The instance has been successfully created and at least one server process has successfully launched and reported back to Amazon GameLift that it is ready to host a game session. The instance is now considered ready to host game sessions.      * __TERMINATING__ -- The instance is in the process of shutting down. This may happen to reduce capacity during a scaling down event or to recycle resources in the event of a problem.
--
-- * 'iIPAddress' - IP address that is assigned to the instance.
--
-- * 'iOperatingSystem' - Operating system that is running on this instance. 
--
-- * 'iType' - EC2 instance type that defines the computing resources of this instance. 
--
-- * 'iFleetId' - A unique identifier for a fleet that the instance is in.
--
-- * 'iDNSName' - DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:     * TLS-enabled fleets: @<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com@ .     * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: @ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com@ . (See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing> .) When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.
