-- | Properties describing a player session. Player session objects are created either by creating a player session for a specific game session, or as part of a game session placement. A player session represents either a player reservation for a game session (status @RESERVED@ ) or actual player activity in a game session (status @ACTIVE@ ). A player session object (including player data) is automatically passed to a game session when the player connects to the game session and is validated.
--
--
-- When a player disconnects, the player session status changes to @COMPLETED@ . Once the session ends, the player session object is retained for 30 days and then removed.

-- | Creates a value of 'PlayerSession' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'psCreationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'psStatus' - Current status of the player session. Possible player session statuses include the following:     * __RESERVED__ -- The player session request has been received, but the player has not yet connected to the server process and/or been validated.      * __ACTIVE__ -- The player has been validated by the server process and is currently connected.     * __COMPLETED__ -- The player connection has been dropped.     * __TIMEDOUT__ -- A player session request was received, but the player did not connect and/or was not validated within the timeout limit (60 seconds).
--
-- * 'psIPAddress' - IP address of the instance that is running the game session. When connecting to a Amazon GameLift game server, a client needs to reference an IP address (or DNS name) and port number.
--
-- * 'psGameSessionId' - A unique identifier for the game session that the player session is connected to.
--
-- * 'psFleetARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) associated with the GameLift fleet that the player's game session is running on. 
--
-- * 'psTerminationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'psPlayerSessionId' - A unique identifier for a player session.
--
-- * 'psFleetId' - A unique identifier for a fleet that the player's game session is running on.
--
-- * 'psPlayerData' - Developer-defined information related to a player. Amazon GameLift does not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed for use in the game. 
--
-- * 'psPlayerId' - A unique identifier for a player that is associated with this player session.
--
-- * 'psDNSName' - DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:     * TLS-enabled fleets: @<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com@ .     * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: @ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com@ . (See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing> .) When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.
--
-- * 'psPort' - Port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift server process, an app needs both the IP address and port number.
