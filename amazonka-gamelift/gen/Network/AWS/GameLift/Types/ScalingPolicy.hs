-- | Creates a value of 'ScalingPolicy' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'spStatus' - Current status of the scaling policy. The scaling policy can be in force only when in an @ACTIVE@ status. Scaling policies can be suspended for individual fleets (see 'StopFleetActions' ; if suspended for a fleet, the policy status does not change. View a fleet's stopped actions by calling 'DescribeFleetCapacity' .     * __ACTIVE__ -- The scaling policy can be used for auto-scaling a fleet.     * __UPDATE_REQUESTED__ -- A request to update the scaling policy has been received.     * __UPDATING__ -- A change is being made to the scaling policy.     * __DELETE_REQUESTED__ -- A request to delete the scaling policy has been received.     * __DELETING__ -- The scaling policy is being deleted.     * __DELETED__ -- The scaling policy has been deleted.     * __ERROR__ -- An error occurred in creating the policy. It should be removed and recreated.
--
-- * 'spScalingAdjustmentType' - The type of adjustment to make to a fleet's instance count (see 'FleetCapacity' ):     * __ChangeInCapacity__ -- add (or subtract) the scaling adjustment value from the current instance count. Positive values scale up while negative values scale down.     * __ExactCapacity__ -- set the instance count to the scaling adjustment value.     * __PercentChangeInCapacity__ -- increase or reduce the current instance count by the scaling adjustment, read as a percentage. Positive values scale up while negative values scale down.
--
-- * 'spEvaluationPeriods' - Length of time (in minutes) the metric must be at or beyond the threshold before a scaling event is triggered.
--
-- * 'spPolicyType' - The type of scaling policy to create. For a target-based policy, set the parameter /MetricName/ to 'PercentAvailableGameSessions' and specify a /TargetConfiguration/ . For a rule-based policy set the following parameters: /MetricName/ , /ComparisonOperator/ , /Threshold/ , /EvaluationPeriods/ , /ScalingAdjustmentType/ , and /ScalingAdjustment/ .
--
-- * 'spMetricName' - Name of the Amazon GameLift-defined metric that is used to trigger a scaling adjustment. For detailed descriptions of fleet metrics, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html Monitor Amazon GameLift with Amazon CloudWatch> .      * __ActivatingGameSessions__ -- Game sessions in the process of being created.     * __ActiveGameSessions__ -- Game sessions that are currently running.     * __ActiveInstances__ -- Fleet instances that are currently running at least one game session.     * __AvailableGameSessions__ -- Additional game sessions that fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity.     * __AvailablePlayerSessions__ -- Empty player slots in currently active game sessions. This includes game sessions that are not currently accepting players. Reserved player slots are not included.     * __CurrentPlayerSessions__ -- Player slots in active game sessions that are being used by a player or are reserved for a player.      * __IdleInstances__ -- Active instances that are currently hosting zero game sessions.      * __PercentAvailableGameSessions__ -- Unused percentage of the total number of game sessions that a fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity. Use this metric for a target-based scaling policy.     * __PercentIdleInstances__ -- Percentage of the total number of active instances that are hosting zero game sessions.     * __QueueDepth__ -- Pending game session placement requests, in any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority destination.     * __WaitTime__ -- Current wait time for pending game session placement requests, in any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority destination. 
--
-- * 'spComparisonOperator' - Comparison operator to use when measuring a metric against the threshold value.
--
-- * 'spName' - A descriptive label that is associated with a scaling policy. Policy names do not need to be unique.
--
-- * 'spThreshold' - Metric value used to trigger a scaling event.
--
-- * 'spScalingAdjustment' - Amount of adjustment to make, based on the scaling adjustment type.
--
-- * 'spFleetId' - A unique identifier for a fleet that is associated with this scaling policy.
--
-- * 'spTargetConfiguration' - The settings for a target-based scaling policy.
