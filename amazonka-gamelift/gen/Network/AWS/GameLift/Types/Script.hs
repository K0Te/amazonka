-- | Creates a value of 'Script' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sCreationTime' - A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'sStorageLocation' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'sName' - A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need to be unique.
--
-- * 'sScriptId' - A unique identifier for a Realtime script
--
-- * 'sVersion' - The version that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique.
--
-- * 'sScriptARN' - Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a GameLift script resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. In a GameLift script ARN, the resource ID matches the /ScriptId/ value.
--
-- * 'sSizeOnDisk' - The file size of the uploaded Realtime script, expressed in bytes. When files are uploaded from an S3 location, this value remains at "0".
