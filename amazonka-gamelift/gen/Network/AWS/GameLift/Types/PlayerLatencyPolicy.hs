-- | Queue setting that determines the highest latency allowed for individual players when placing a game session. When a latency policy is in force, a game session cannot be placed with any fleet in a Region where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are only enforced when the placement request contains player latency information.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'plpPolicyDurationSeconds' - The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.
--
-- * 'plpMaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds' - The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All policies must have a value set for this property.
