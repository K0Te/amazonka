-- | Creates a value of 'Build' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bCreationTime' - Time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").
--
-- * 'bStatus' - Current status of the build. Possible build statuses include the following:     * __INITIALIZED__ -- A new build has been defined, but no files have been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for builds that are in this status. When a build is successfully created, the build status is set to this value.      * __READY__ -- The game build has been successfully uploaded. You can now create new fleets for this build.     * __FAILED__ -- The game build upload failed. You cannot create new fleets for this build. 
--
-- * 'bOperatingSystem' - Operating system that the game server binaries are built to run on. This value determines the type of fleet resources that you can use for this build.
--
-- * 'bBuildId' - A unique identifier for a build.
--
-- * 'bName' - A descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names do not need to be unique. It can be set using 'CreateBuild' or 'UpdateBuild' .
--
-- * 'bVersion' - Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique. This value can be set using 'CreateBuild' or 'UpdateBuild' .
--
-- * 'bBuildARN' - Amazon Resource Name (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a GameLift build resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. In a GameLift build ARN, the resource ID matches the /BuildId/ value.
--
-- * 'bSizeOnDisk' - File size of the uploaded game build, expressed in bytes. When the build status is @INITIALIZED@ , this value is 0.
