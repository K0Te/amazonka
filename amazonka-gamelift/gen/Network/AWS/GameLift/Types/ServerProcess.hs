-- | A set of instructions for launching server processes on each instance in a fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable or a Realtime Servers script. Each instruction set identifies the location of the custom game build executable or Realtime launch script, optional launch parameters, and the number of server processes with this configuration to maintain concurrently on the instance. Server process configurations make up a fleet's @'RuntimeConfiguration' @ .

-- | Creates a value of 'ServerProcess' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'spParameters' - An optional list of parameters to pass to the server executable or Realtime script on launch.
--
-- * 'spLaunchPath' - The location of the server executable in a custom game build or the name of the Realtime script file that contains the @Init()@ function. Game builds and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at the root:      * Windows (for custom game builds only): @C:\game@ . Example: "@C:\game\MyGame\server.exe@ "      * Linux: @/local/game@ . Examples: "@/local/game/MyGame/server.exe@ " or "@/local/game/MyRealtimeScript.js@ "
--
-- * 'spConcurrentExecutions' - The number of server processes that use this configuration to run concurrently on an instance.
