-- Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. If you're also using GameLift hosting, a new game session is started for the matched players. Each matchmaking request identifies one or more players to find a match for, and specifies the type of match to build, including the team configuration and the rules for an acceptable match. When a matchmaking request identifies a group of players who want to play together, FlexMatch finds additional players to fill the match. Match type, rules, and other features are defined in a @MatchmakingConfiguration@ . 
--
--
-- To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. For each player, you must also include the player attribute values that are required by the matchmaking configuration (in the rule set). If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to @QUEUED@ . 
--
-- Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. If you're also using GameLift hosting, a successfully completed ticket contains game session connection information. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.
