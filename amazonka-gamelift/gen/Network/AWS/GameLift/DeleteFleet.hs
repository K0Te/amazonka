-- Deletes everything related to a fleet. Before deleting a fleet, you must set the fleet's desired capacity to zero. See 'UpdateFleetCapacity' .
--
--
-- If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling 'CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization' . You do not need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection--this is done as part of the delete fleet process.
--
-- This operation removes the fleet and its resources. Once a fleet is deleted, you can no longer use any of the resource in that fleet.
