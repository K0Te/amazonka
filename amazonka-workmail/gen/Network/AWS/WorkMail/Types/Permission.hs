-- | Creates a value of 'Permission' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pGranteeId' - The identifier of the user, group, or resource to which the permissions are granted.
--
-- * 'pGranteeType' - The type of user, group, or resource referred to in GranteeId.
--
-- * 'pPermissionValues' - The permissions granted to the grantee. SEND_AS allows the grantee to send email as the owner of the mailbox (the grantee is not mentioned on these emails). SEND_ON_BEHALF allows the grantee to send email on behalf of the owner of the mailbox (the grantee is not mentioned as the physical sender of these emails). FULL_ACCESS allows the grantee full access to the mailbox, irrespective of other folder-level permissions set on the mailbox.
