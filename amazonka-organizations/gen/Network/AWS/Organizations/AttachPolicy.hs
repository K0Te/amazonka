-- Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy. Refer to the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ for information about each policy type:

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'apPolicyId' - The unique identifier (ID) of the policy that you want to attach to the target. You can get the ID for the policy by calling the 'ListPolicies' operation. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a policy ID string requires "p-" followed by from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, digits, or the underscore character (_).
--
-- * 'apTargetId' - The unique identifier (ID) of the root, OU, or account that you want to attach the policy to. You can get the ID by calling the 'ListRoots' , 'ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent' , or 'ListAccounts' operations. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a target ID string requires one of the following:     * __Root__ - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.     * __Account__ - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.     * __Organizational unit (OU)__ - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.
