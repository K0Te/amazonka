-- | Creates a value of 'OrganizationalUnit' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ouARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this OU. For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions.html#orgs-permissions-arns ARN Formats Supported by Organizations> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'ouName' - The friendly name of this OU. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> that is used to validate this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.
--
-- * 'ouId' - The unique identifier (ID) associated with this OU. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for an organizational unit ID string requires "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.
