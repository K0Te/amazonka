-- | Creates a value of 'Root' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the root. For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions.html#orgs-permissions-arns ARN Formats Supported by Organizations> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'rName' - The friendly name of the root. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> that is used to validate this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.
--
-- * 'rId' - The unique identifier (ID) for the root. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a root ID string requires "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
--
-- * 'rPolicyTypes' - The types of policies that are currently enabled for the root and therefore can be attached to the root or to its OUs or accounts.
