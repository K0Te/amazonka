The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a child ID string requires one of the following:     * __Account__ - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.     * __Organizational unit (OU)__ - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.
