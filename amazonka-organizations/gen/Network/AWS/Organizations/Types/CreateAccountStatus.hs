-- | Creates a value of 'CreateAccountStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'casFailureReason' - If the request failed, a description of the reason for the failure.     * ACCOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: The account could not be created because you have reached the limit on the number of accounts in your organization.     * CONCURRENT_ACCOUNT_MODIFICATION: You already submitted a request with the same information.     * EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account could not be created because another AWS account with that email address already exists.     * GOVCLOUD_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region could not be created because this Region already includes an account with that email address.     * INVALID_ADDRESS: The account could not be created because the address you provided is not valid.     * INVALID_EMAIL: The account could not be created because the email address you provided is not valid.     * INTERNAL_FAILURE: The account could not be created because of an internal failure. Try again later. If the problem persists, contact Customer Support.     * MISSING_BUSINESS_VALIDATION: The AWS account that owns your organization has not received Business Validation.     * MISSING_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT: You must configure the management account with a valid payment method, such as a credit card.
--
-- * 'casState' - The status of the request.
--
-- * 'casCompletedTimestamp' - The date and time that the account was created and the request completed.
--
-- * 'casAccountName' - The account name given to the account when it was created.
--
-- * 'casAccountId' - If the account was created successfully, the unique identifier (ID) of the new account. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for an account ID string requires exactly 12 digits.
--
-- * 'casId' - The unique identifier (ID) that references this request. You get this value from the response of the initial 'CreateAccount' request to create the account. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a create account request ID string requires "car-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
--
-- * 'casGovCloudAccountId' - If the account was created successfully, the unique identifier (ID) of the new account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.
--
-- * 'casRequestedTimestamp' - The date and time that the request was made for the account creation.
