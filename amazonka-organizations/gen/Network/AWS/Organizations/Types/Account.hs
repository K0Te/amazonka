-- | Creates a value of 'Account' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aStatus' - The status of the account in the organization.
--
-- * 'aJoinedMethod' - The method by which the account joined the organization.
--
-- * 'aEmail' - The email address associated with the AWS account. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for this parameter is a string of characters that represents a standard internet email address.
--
-- * 'aARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the account. For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions.html#orgs-permissions-arns ARN Formats Supported by Organizations> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'aJoinedTimestamp' - The date the account became a part of the organization.
--
-- * 'aName' - The friendly name of the account. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> that is used to validate this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.
--
-- * 'aId' - The unique identifier (ID) of the account. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for an account ID string requires exactly 12 digits.
