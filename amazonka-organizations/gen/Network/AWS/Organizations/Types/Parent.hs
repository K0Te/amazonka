-- * 'pId' - The unique identifier (ID) of the parent entity. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a parent ID string requires one of the following:     * __Root__ - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.     * __Organizational unit (OU)__ - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.
--
-- * 'pType' - The type of the parent entity.
