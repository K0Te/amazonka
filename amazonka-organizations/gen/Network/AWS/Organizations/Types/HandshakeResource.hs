-- | Creates a value of 'HandshakeResource' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'hrValue' - The information that is passed to the other party in the handshake. The format of the value string must match the requirements of the specified type.
--
-- * 'hrResources' - When needed, contains an additional array of @HandshakeResource@ objects.
--
-- * 'hrType' - The type of information being passed, specifying how the value is to be interpreted by the other party:     * @ACCOUNT@ - Specifies an AWS account ID number.     * @ORGANIZATION@ - Specifies an organization ID number.     * @EMAIL@ - Specifies the email address that is associated with the account that receives the handshake.      * @OWNER_EMAIL@ - Specifies the email address associated with the management account. Included as information about an organization.      * @OWNER_NAME@ - Specifies the name associated with the management account. Included as information about an organization.      * @NOTES@ - Additional text provided by the handshake initiator and intended for the recipient to read.
