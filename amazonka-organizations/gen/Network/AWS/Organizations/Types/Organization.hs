-- | Creates a value of 'Organization' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'oARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization. For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions.html#orgs-permissions-arns ARN Formats Supported by Organizations> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'oMasterAccountId' - The unique identifier (ID) of the management account of an organization. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for an account ID string requires exactly 12 digits.
--
-- * 'oMasterAccountARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the account that is designated as the management account for the organization. For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions.html#orgs-permissions-arns ARN Formats Supported by Organizations> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'oMasterAccountEmail' - The email address that is associated with the AWS account that is designated as the management account for the organization.
--
-- * 'oAvailablePolicyTypes' - /Important:/ Do not use. This field is deprecated and doesn't provide complete information about the policies in your organization. To determine the policies that are enabled and available for use in your organization, use the 'ListRoots' operation instead.
--
-- * 'oId' - The unique identifier (ID) of an organization. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for an organization ID string requires "o-" followed by from 10 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
--
-- * 'oFeatureSet' - Specifies the functionality that currently is available to the organization. If set to "ALL", then all features are enabled and policies can be applied to accounts in the organization. If set to "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING", then only consolidated billing functionality is available. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html Enabling All Features in Your Organization> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ .
