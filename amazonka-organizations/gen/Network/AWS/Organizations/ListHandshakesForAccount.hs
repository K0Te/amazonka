-- Lists the current handshakes that are associated with the account of the requesting user.
--
--
-- Handshakes that are @ACCEPTED@ , @DECLINED@ , or @CANCELED@ appear in the results of this API for only 30 days after changing to that state. After that, they're deleted and no longer accessible.

-- This operation can be called from any account in the organization.

-- | Creates a value of 'ListHandshakesForAccount' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lhfaNextToken' - The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a @NextToken@ response in a previous request. A @NextToken@ response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's @NextToken@ response to indicate where the output should continue from.
--
-- * 'lhfaFilter' - Filters the handshakes that you want included in the response. The default is all types. Use the @ActionType@ element to limit the output to only a specified type, such as @INVITE@ , @ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES@ , or @APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES@ . Alternatively, for the @ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES@ handshake that generates a separate child handshake for each member account, you can specify @ParentHandshakeId@ to see only the handshakes that were generated by that parent request.
--
-- * 'lhfaMaxResults' - The total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the @NextToken@ response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the @NextToken@ request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check @NextToken@ after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
