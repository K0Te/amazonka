-- You can run this action only for AWS services that support this feature. For a current list of services that support it, see the column /Supports Delegated Administrator/ in the table at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrated-services-list.html AWS Services that you can use with AWS Organizations> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide./
