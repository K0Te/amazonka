-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bciResourceId' - The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).
--
-- * 'bciResourceType' - The type of AWS resource.
--
-- * 'bciConfigurationStateId' - An identifier that indicates the ordering of the configuration items of a resource.
--

--
-- * 'bciResourceCreationTime' - The time stamp when the resource was created.
--
-- * 'bciConfigurationItemStatus' - The configuration item status. The valid values are:     * OK – The resource configuration has been updated     * ResourceDiscovered – The resource was newly discovered     * ResourceNotRecorded – The resource was discovered but its configuration was not recorded since the recorder excludes the recording of resources of this type     * ResourceDeleted – The resource was deleted     * ResourceDeletedNotRecorded – The resource was deleted but its configuration was not recorded since the recorder excludes the recording of resources of this type
--
-- * 'bciConfigurationItemCaptureTime' - The time when the configuration recording was initiated.
--
-- * 'bciAccountId' - The 12-digit AWS account ID associated with the resource.
--
-- * 'bciSupplementaryConfiguration' - Configuration attributes that AWS Config returns for certain resource types to supplement the information returned for the configuration parameter.
--
-- * 'bciAvailabilityZone' - The Availability Zone associated with the resource.
--
-- * 'bciVersion' - The version number of the resource configuration.
