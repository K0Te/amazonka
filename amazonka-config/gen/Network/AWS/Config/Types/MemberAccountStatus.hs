-- | Creates a value of 'MemberAccountStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'masErrorCode' - An error code that is returned when config rule creation or deletion failed in the member account.
--
-- * 'masErrorMessage' - An error message indicating that config rule account creation or deletion has failed due to an error in the member account.
--
-- * 'masLastUpdateTime' - The timestamp of the last status update.
--
-- * 'masAccountId' - The 12-digit account ID of a member account.
--
-- * 'masConfigRuleName' - The name of config rule deployed in the member account.
--
-- * 'masMemberAccountRuleStatus' - Indicates deployment status for config rule in the member account. When master account calls @PutOrganizationConfigRule@ action for the first time, config rule status is created in the member account. When master account calls @PutOrganizationConfigRule@ action for the second time, config rule status is updated in the member account. Config rule status is deleted when the master account deletes @OrganizationConfigRule@ and disables service access for @config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com@ .  AWS Config sets the state of the rule to:     * @CREATE_SUCCESSFUL@ when config rule has been created in the member account.      * @CREATE_IN_PROGRESS@ when config rule is being created in the member account.     * @CREATE_FAILED@ when config rule creation has failed in the member account.     * @DELETE_FAILED@ when config rule deletion has failed in the member account.     * @DELETE_IN_PROGRESS@ when config rule is being deleted in the member account.     * @DELETE_SUCCESSFUL@ when config rule has been deleted in the member account.      * @UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL@ when config rule has been updated in the member account.     * @UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS@ when config rule is being updated in the member account.     * @UPDATE_FAILED@ when config rule deletion has failed in the member account.
