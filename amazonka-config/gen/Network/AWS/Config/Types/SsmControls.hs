-- | Creates a value of 'SsmControls' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'scConcurrentExecutionRatePercentage' - The maximum percentage of remediation actions allowed to run in parallel on the non-compliant resources for that specific rule. You can specify a percentage, such as 10%. The default value is 10. 
--
-- * 'scErrorPercentage' - The percentage of errors that are allowed before SSM stops running automations on non-compliant resources for that specific rule. You can specify a percentage of errors, for example 10%. If you do not specifiy a percentage, the default is 50%. For example, if you set the ErrorPercentage to 40% for 10 non-compliant resources, then SSM stops running the automations when the fifth error is received.
