-- | Creates a value of 'Compliance' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cComplianceContributorCount' - The number of AWS resources or AWS Config rules that cause a result of @NON_COMPLIANT@ , up to a maximum number.
--
-- * 'cComplianceType' - Indicates whether an AWS resource or AWS Config rule is compliant. A resource is compliant if it complies with all of the AWS Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules. A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule evaluates comply with it. A rule is noncompliant if any of these resources do not comply. AWS Config returns the @INSUFFICIENT_DATA@ value when no evaluation results are available for the AWS resource or AWS Config rule. For the @Compliance@ data type, AWS Config supports only @COMPLIANT@ , @NON_COMPLIANT@ , and @INSUFFICIENT_DATA@ values. AWS Config does not support the @NOT_APPLICABLE@ value for the @Compliance@ data type.
