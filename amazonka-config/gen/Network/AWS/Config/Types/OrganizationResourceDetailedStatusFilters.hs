-- | Creates a value of 'OrganizationResourceDetailedStatusFilters' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ordsfStatus' - Indicates deployment status for conformance pack in a member account. When master account calls @PutOrganizationConformancePack@ action for the first time, conformance pack status is created in the member account. When master account calls @PutOrganizationConformancePack@ action for the second time, conformance pack status is updated in the member account. Conformance pack status is deleted when the master account deletes @OrganizationConformancePack@ and disables service access for @config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com@ .  AWS Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:     * @CREATE_SUCCESSFUL@ when conformance pack has been created in the member account.      * @CREATE_IN_PROGRESS@ when conformance pack is being created in the member account.     * @CREATE_FAILED@ when conformance pack creation has failed in the member account.     * @DELETE_FAILED@ when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.     * @DELETE_IN_PROGRESS@ when conformance pack is being deleted in the member account.     * @DELETE_SUCCESSFUL@ when conformance pack has been deleted in the member account.      * @UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL@ when conformance pack has been updated in the member account.     * @UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS@ when conformance pack is being updated in the member account.     * @UPDATE_FAILED@ when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.
--
-- * 'ordsfAccountId' - The 12-digit account ID of the member account within an organization.
