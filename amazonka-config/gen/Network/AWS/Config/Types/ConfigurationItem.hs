-- | Creates a value of 'ConfigurationItem' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ciResourceId' - The ID of the resource (for example, @sg-xxxxxx@ ).
--
-- * 'ciResourceType' - The type of AWS resource.
--
-- * 'ciConfigurationStateId' - An identifier that indicates the ordering of the configuration items of a resource.
--
-- * 'ciArn' - accoun
--
-- * 'ciResourceName' - The custom name of the resource, if available.
--
-- * 'ciResourceCreationTime' - The time stamp when the resource was created.
--
-- * 'ciConfigurationItemStatus' - The configuration item status. The valid values are:     * OK – The resource configuration has been updated     * ResourceDiscovered – The resource was newly discovered     * ResourceNotRecorded – The resource was discovered but its configuration was not recorded since the recorder excludes the recording of resources of this type     * ResourceDeleted – The resource was deleted     * ResourceDeletedNotRecorded – The resource was deleted but its configuration was not recorded since the recorder excludes the recording of resources of this type
--
-- * 'ciConfigurationItemCaptureTime' - The time when the configuration recording was initiated.
--
-- * 'ciAccountId' - The 12-digit AWS account ID associated with the resource.
--
-- * 'ciSupplementaryConfiguration' - Configuration attributes that AWS Config returns for certain resource types to supplement the information returned for the @configuration@ parameter.
--
-- * 'ciAvailabilityZone' - The Availability Zone associated with the resource.
--
-- * 'ciRelationships' - A list of related AWS resources.
--
-- * 'ciVersion' - The version number of the resource configuration.
--
-- * 'ciAwsRegion' - The region where the resource resides.
--
-- * 'ciRelatedEvents' - A list of CloudTrail event IDs. A populated field indicates that the current configuration was initiated by the events recorded in the CloudTrail log. For more information about CloudTrail, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html What Is AWS CloudTrail> . An empty field indicates that the current configuration was not initiated by any event. As of Version 1.3, the relatedEvents field is empty. You can access the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_LookupEvents.html LookupEvents API> in the /AWS CloudTrail API Reference/ to retrieve the events for the resource.
--
-- * 'ciConfiguration' - The description of the resource configuration.
--
-- * 'ciConfigurationItemMD5Hash' - Unique MD5 hash that represents the configuration item's state. You can use MD5 hash to compare the states of two or more configuration items that are associated with the same resource.
--
-- * 'ciTags' - A mapping of key value tags associated with the resource.
