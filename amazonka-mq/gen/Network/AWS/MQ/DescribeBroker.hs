--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dbrsBrokerName' - The name of the broker. This value must be unique in your AWS account, 1-50 characters long, must contain only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores, and must not contain whitespaces, brackets, wildcard characters, or special characters.
--
-- * 'dbrsEngineVersion' - The version of the broker engine. For a list of supported engine versions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/broker-engine.html
--
-- * 'dbrsPendingAuthenticationStrategy' - The authentication strategy that will be applied when the broker is rebooted.
--
-- * 'dbrsBrokerState' - The status of the broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsPubliclyAccessible' - Required. Enables connections from applications outside of the VPC that hosts the broker's subnets.
--
-- * 'dbrsAutoMinorVersionUpgrade' - Required. Enables automatic upgrades to new minor versions for brokers, as Apache releases the versions. The automatic upgrades occur during the maintenance window of the broker or after a manual broker reboot.
--
-- * 'dbrsSecurityGroups' - The list of security groups (1 minimum, 5 maximum) that authorizes connections to brokers.
--
-- * 'dbrsUsers' - The list of all broker usernames for the specified broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsPendingSecurityGroups' - The list of pending security groups to authorize connections to brokers.
--
-- * 'dbrsSubnetIds' - The list of groups that define which subnets and IP ranges the broker can use from different Availability Zones. A SINGLE_INSTANCE deployment requires one subnet (for example, the default subnet). An ACTIVE_STANDBY_MULTI_AZ deployment (ACTIVEMQ) requires two subnets. A CLUSTER_MULTI_AZ deployment (RABBITMQ) has no subnet requirements when deployed with public accessibility, deployment without public accessibility requires at least one subnet.
--
-- * 'dbrsCreated' - The time when the broker was created.
--
-- * 'dbrsConfigurations' - The list of all revisions for the specified configuration.
--
-- * 'dbrsAuthenticationStrategy' - The authentication strategy used to secure the broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsPendingHostInstanceType' - The host instance type of the broker to upgrade to. For a list of supported instance types, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide//broker.html#broker-instance-types
--
-- * 'dbrsLdapServerMetadata' - The metadata of the LDAP server used to authenticate and authorize connections to the broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsMaintenanceWindowStartTime' - The parameters that determine the WeeklyStartTime.
--
-- * 'dbrsLogs' - The list of information about logs currently enabled and pending to be deployed for the specified broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsEncryptionOptions' - Encryption options for the broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsDeploymentMode' - Required. The deployment mode of the broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsPendingEngineVersion' - The version of the broker engine to upgrade to. For a list of supported engine versions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/broker-engine.html
--
-- * 'dbrsBrokerId' - The unique ID that Amazon MQ generates for the broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsPendingLdapServerMetadata' - The metadata of the LDAP server that will be used to authenticate and authorize connections to the broker once it is rebooted.
--
-- * 'dbrsEngineType' - Required. The type of broker engine. Note: Currently, Amazon MQ supports ACTIVEMQ and RABBITMQ.
--
-- * 'dbrsBrokerARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsTags' - The list of all tags associated with this broker.
--
-- * 'dbrsBrokerInstances' - A list of information about allocated brokers.
--
-- * 'dbrsHostInstanceType' - The broker's instance type.
