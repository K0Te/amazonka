-- | Creates a value of 'CognitoStreams' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'csStreamingStatus' - Status of the Cognito streams. Valid values are: ENABLED - Streaming of updates to identity pool is enabled. DISABLED - Streaming of updates to identity pool is disabled. Bulk publish will also fail if StreamingStatus is DISABLED.
--
-- * 'csStreamName' - The name of the Cognito stream to receive updates. This stream must be in the developers account and in the same region as the identity pool.
--
-- * 'csRoleARN' - The ARN of the role Amazon Cognito can assume in order to publish to the stream. This role must grant access to Amazon Cognito (cognito-sync) to invoke PutRecord on your Cognito stream.
