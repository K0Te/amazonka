-- | Creates a value of 'AutomaticTapeCreationRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'atcrWorm' - Set to @true@ to indicate that tapes are to be archived as write-once-read-many (WORM). Set to @false@ when WORM is not enabled for tapes.
--
-- * 'atcrTapeBarcodePrefix' - A prefix that you append to the barcode of the virtual tape that you are creating. This prefix makes the barcode unique.
--
-- * 'atcrPoolId' - The ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving. The tape in this pool is archived in the Amazon S3 storage class that is associated with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class (S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool. Valid Values: @GLACIER@ | @DEEP_ARCHIVE@ 
--
-- * 'atcrTapeSizeInBytes' - The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape capacity.
--
-- * 'atcrMinimumNumTapes' - The minimum number of available virtual tapes that the gateway maintains at all times. If the number of tapes on the gateway goes below this value, the gateway creates as many new tapes as are needed to have @MinimumNumTapes@ on the gateway.
