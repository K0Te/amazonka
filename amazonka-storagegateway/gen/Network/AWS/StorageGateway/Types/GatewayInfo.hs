-- | Creates a value of 'GatewayInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'giEC2InstanceRegion' - The AWS Region where the Amazon EC2 instance is located.
--
-- * 'giGatewayARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the 'ListGateways' operation to return a list of gateways for your account and AWS Region.
--
-- * 'giEC2InstanceId' - The ID of the Amazon EC2 instance that was used to launch the gateway.
--
-- * 'giGatewayOperationalState' - The state of the gateway. Valid Values: @DISABLED@ | @ACTIVE@ 
--
-- * 'giGatewayName' - The name of the gateway.
--
-- * 'giGatewayId' - The unique identifier assigned to your gateway during activation. This ID becomes part of the gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which you use as input for other operations.
--
-- * 'giGatewayType' - The type of the gateway.
