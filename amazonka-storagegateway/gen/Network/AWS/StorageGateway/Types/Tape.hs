-- | Creates a value of 'Tape' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tTapeBarcode' - The barcode that identifies a specific virtual tape.
--
-- * 'tTapeStatus' - The current state of the virtual tape.
--
-- * 'tKMSKey' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'tTapeARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape.
--
-- * 'tProgress' - For archiving virtual tapes, indicates how much data remains to be uploaded before archiving is complete. Range: 0 (not started) to 100 (complete).
--
-- * 'tTapeSizeInBytes' - The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape capacity.
--
-- * 'tVTLDevice' - The virtual tape library (VTL) device that the virtual tape is associated with.
--
-- * 'tPoolId' - The ID of the pool that contains tapes that will be archived. The tapes in this pool are archived in the S3 storage class that is associated with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class (S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool. Valid Values: @GLACIER@ | @DEEP_ARCHIVE@ 
--
-- * 'tTapeUsedInBytes' - The size, in bytes, of data stored on the virtual tape.
--
-- * 'tTapeCreatedDate' - The date the virtual tape was created.
--
-- * 'tPoolEntryDate' - The date that the tape enters a custom tape pool.
--
-- * 'tWorm' - If the tape is archived as write-once-read-many (WORM), this value is @true@ .
--
-- * 'tRetentionStartDate' - The date that the tape is first archived with tape retention lock enabled.
