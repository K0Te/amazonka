-- Assigns a tape to a tape pool for archiving. The tape assigned to a pool is archived in the S3 storage class that is associated with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the S3 storage class (S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

-- * 'atpBypassGovernanceRetention' - Set permissions to bypass governance retention. If the lock type of the archived tape is @Governance@ , the tape's archived age is not older than @RetentionLockInDays@ , and the user does not already have @BypassGovernanceRetention@ , setting this to TRUE enables the user to bypass the retention lock.
