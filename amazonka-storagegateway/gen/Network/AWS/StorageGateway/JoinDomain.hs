-- | Creates a value of 'JoinDomain' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jdOrganizationalUnit' - The organizational unit (OU) is a container in an Active Directory that can hold users, groups, computers, and other OUs and this parameter specifies the OU that the gateway will join within the AD domain.
--
-- * 'jdTimeoutInSeconds' - Specifies the time in seconds, in which the @JoinDomain@ operation must complete. The default is 20 seconds.
--
-- * 'jdDomainControllers' - List of IPv4 addresses, NetBIOS names, or host names of your domain server. If you need to specify the port number include it after the colon (“:”). For example, @mydc.mydomain.com:389@ .
--
-- * 'jdGatewayARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the @ListGateways@ operation to return a list of gateways for your account and AWS Region.
--
-- * 'jdDomainName' - The name of the domain that you want the gateway to join.
--
-- * 'jdUserName' - Sets the user name of user who has permission to add the gateway to the Active Directory domain. The domain user account should be enabled to join computers to the domain. For example, you can use the domain administrator account or an account with delegated permissions to join computers to the domain.
--
-- * 'jdPassword' - Sets the password of the user who has permission to add the gateway to the Active Directory domain.
