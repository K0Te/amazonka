-- | Describes an API key.
--
--
-- Customers invoke AWS AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as an identity mechanism. There are two key versions:
--
-- __da1__ : This version was introduced at launch in November 2017. These keys always expire after 7 days. Key expiration is managed by Amazon DynamoDB TTL. The keys ceased to be valid after February 21, 2018 and should not be used after that date.
--
--     * @ListApiKeys@ returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
--
--     * @CreateApiKey@ returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
--
--     * @UpdateApiKey@ is not available for this key version.
--
--     * @DeleteApiKey@ deletes the item from the table.
--
--     * Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results in a bug where keys are not automatically deleted because DynamoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one-time action, we will delete these keys from the table after February 21, 2018.
--
--
--
-- __da2__ : This version was introduced in February 2018 when AppSync added support to extend key expiration.
--
--     * @ListApiKeys@ returns the expiration time and deletion time in seconds.
--
--     * @CreateApiKey@ returns the expiration time and deletion time in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds.
--
--     * @UpdateApiKey@ returns the expiration time and and deletion time in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds. Expired API keys are kept for 60 days after the expiration time. Key expiration time can be updated while the key is not deleted. 
--
--     * @DeleteApiKey@ deletes the item from the table.
--
--     * Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. After the expiration time, using the key to authenticate will fail. But the key can be reinstated before deletion.
--
--     * Deletion is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. The key will be deleted after deletion time.
