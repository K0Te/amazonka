-- | Creates a value of 'GetProtectionStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gpsMemberAccountId' - The AWS account that is in scope of the policy that you want to get the details for.
--
-- * 'gpsStartTime' - The start of the time period to query for the attacks. This is a @timestamp@ type. The request syntax listing indicates a @number@ type because the default used by AWS Firewall Manager is Unix time in seconds. However, any valid @timestamp@ format is allowed.
--
-- * 'gpsNextToken' - If you specify a value for @MaxResults@ and you have more objects than the number that you specify for @MaxResults@ , AWS Firewall Manager returns a @NextToken@ value in the response, which you can use to retrieve another group of objects. For the second and subsequent @GetProtectionStatus@ requests, specify the value of @NextToken@ from the previous response to get information about another batch of objects.
--
-- * 'gpsEndTime' - The end of the time period to query for the attacks. This is a @timestamp@ type. The request syntax listing indicates a @number@ type because the default used by AWS Firewall Manager is Unix time in seconds. However, any valid @timestamp@ format is allowed.
--
-- * 'gpsMaxResults' - Specifies the number of objects that you want AWS Firewall Manager to return for this request. If you have more objects than the number that you specify for @MaxResults@ , the response includes a @NextToken@ value that you can use to get another batch of objects.
--
-- * 'gpsPolicyId' - The ID of the policy for which you want to get the attack information.
