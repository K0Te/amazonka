-- | Creates a value of 'EvaluationResult' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'erViolatorCount' - The number of resources that are noncompliant with the specified policy. For AWS WAF and Shield Advanced policies, a resource is considered noncompliant if it is not associated with the policy. For security group policies, a resource is considered noncompliant if it doesn't comply with the rules of the policy and remediation is disabled or not possible.
--
-- * 'erComplianceStatus' - Describes an AWS account's compliance with the AWS Firewall Manager policy.
--
-- * 'erEvaluationLimitExceeded' - Indicates that over 100 resources are noncompliant with the AWS Firewall Manager policy.
