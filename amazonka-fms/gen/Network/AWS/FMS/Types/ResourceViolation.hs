-- | Creates a value of 'ResourceViolation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rvNetworkFirewallMissingExpectedRTViolation' - Violation detail for an Network Firewall policy that indicates that a subnet is not associated with the expected Firewall Manager managed route table. 
--
-- * 'rvNetworkFirewallMissingFirewallViolation' - Violation detail for an Network Firewall policy that indicates that a subnet has no Firewall Manager managed firewall in its VPC. 
--
-- * 'rvNetworkFirewallMissingSubnetViolation' - Violation detail for an Network Firewall policy that indicates that an Availability Zone is missing the expected Firewall Manager managed subnet.
--
-- * 'rvAWSEC2InstanceViolation' - Violation details for an EC2 instance.
--
-- * 'rvAWSVPCSecurityGroupViolation' - Violation details for security groups.
--
-- * 'rvNetworkFirewallPolicyModifiedViolation' - Violation detail for an Network Firewall policy that indicates that a firewall policy in an individual account has been modified in a way that makes it noncompliant. For example, the individual account owner might have deleted a rule group, changed the priority of a stateless rule group, or changed a policy default action.
--
-- * 'rvAWSEC2NetworkInterfaceViolation' - Violation details for network interface.
