-- | Creates a value of 'PolicyComplianceDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pcdExpiredAt' - A timestamp that indicates when the returned information should be considered out of date.
--
-- * 'pcdPolicyId' - The ID of the AWS Firewall Manager policy.
--
-- * 'pcdViolators' - An array of resources that aren't protected by the AWS WAF or Shield Advanced policy or that aren't in compliance with the security group policy.
--
-- * 'pcdEvaluationLimitExceeded' - Indicates if over 100 resources are noncompliant with the AWS Firewall Manager policy.
--
-- * 'pcdIssueInfoMap' - Details about problems with dependent services, such as AWS WAF or AWS Config, that are causing a resource to be noncompliant. The details include the name of the dependent service and the error message received that indicates the problem with the service.
--
-- * 'pcdPolicyOwner' - The AWS account that created the AWS Firewall Manager policy.
--
-- * 'pcdMemberAccount' - The AWS account ID.
