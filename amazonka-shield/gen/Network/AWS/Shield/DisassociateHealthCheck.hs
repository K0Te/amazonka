-- Removes health-based detection from the Shield Advanced protection for a resource. Shield Advanced health-based detection uses the health of your AWS resource to improve responsiveness and accuracy in attack detection and mitigation. 
--
--
-- You define the health check in Route 53 and then associate or disassociate it with your Shield Advanced protection. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-overview.html#ddos-advanced-health-check-option Shield Advanced Health-Based Detection> in the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ AWS WAF and AWS Shield Developer Guide> .
