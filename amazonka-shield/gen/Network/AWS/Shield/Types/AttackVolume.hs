-- | Creates a value of 'AttackVolume' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'avPacketsPerSecond' - A statistics object that uses packets per second as the unit. This is included for network level attacks. 
--
-- * 'avRequestsPerSecond' - A statistics object that uses requests per second as the unit. This is included for application level attacks, and is only available for accounts that are subscribed to Shield Advanced.
--
-- * 'avBitsPerSecond' - A statistics object that uses bits per second as the unit. This is included for network level attacks.
