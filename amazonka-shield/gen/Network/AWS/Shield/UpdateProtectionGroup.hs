-- Updates an existing protection group. A protection group is a grouping of protected resources so they can be handled as a collective. This resource grouping improves the accuracy of detection and reduces false positives.

-- | Creates a value of 'UpdateProtectionGroup' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'upgResourceType' - The resource type to include in the protection group. All protected resources of this type are included in the protection group. You must set this when you set @Pattern@ to @BY_RESOURCE_TYPE@ and you must not set it for any other @Pattern@ setting. 
--
-- * 'upgMembers' - The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to include in the protection group. You must set this when you set @Pattern@ to @ARBITRARY@ and you must not set it for any other @Pattern@ setting. 
--
-- * 'upgProtectionGroupId' - The name of the protection group. You use this to identify the protection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for example to update, delete, or describe it. 
--
-- * 'upgAggregation' - Defines how AWS Shield combines resource data for the group in order to detect, mitigate, and report events.     * Sum - Use the total traffic across the group. This is a good choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP addresses for EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically.     * Mean - Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is a good choice for resources that share traffic uniformly. Examples include accelerators and load balancers.     * Max - Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is useful for resources that don't share traffic and for resources that share that traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples include CloudFront distributions and origin resources for CloudFront distributions.
--
-- * 'upgPattern' - The criteria to use to choose the protected resources for inclusion in the group. You can include all resources that have protections, provide a list of resource Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), or include all resources of a specified resource type.
