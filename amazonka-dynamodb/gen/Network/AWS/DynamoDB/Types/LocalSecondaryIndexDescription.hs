-- | Creates a value of 'LocalSecondaryIndexDescription' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lsidIndexSizeBytes' - The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.
--
-- * 'lsidIndexARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the index.
--
-- * 'lsidKeySchema' - The complete key schema for the local secondary index, consisting of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:     * @HASH@ - partition key     * @RANGE@ - sort key
--
-- * 'lsidProjection' - Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. 
--
-- * 'lsidItemCount' - The number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.
--
-- * 'lsidIndexName' - Represents the name of the local secondary index.
