-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ssStreamViewType' - When an item in the table is modified, @StreamViewType@ determines what information is written to the stream for this table. Valid values for @StreamViewType@ are:     * @KEYS_ONLY@ - Only the key attributes of the modified item are written to the stream.     * @NEW_IMAGE@ - The entire item, as it appears after it was modified, is written to the stream.     * @OLD_IMAGE@ - The entire item, as it appeared before it was modified, is written to the stream.     * @NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES@ - Both the new and the old item images of the item are written to the stream.
--
-- * 'ssStreamEnabled' - Indicates whether DynamoDB Streams is enabled (true) or disabled (false) on the table.
