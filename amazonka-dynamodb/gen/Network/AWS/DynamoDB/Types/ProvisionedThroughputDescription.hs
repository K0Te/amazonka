-- | Creates a value of 'ProvisionedThroughputDescription' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ptdReadCapacityUnits' - The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a @ThrottlingException@ . Eventually consistent reads require less effort than strongly consistent reads, so a setting of 50 @ReadCapacityUnits@ per second provides 100 eventually consistent @ReadCapacityUnits@ per second.
--
-- * 'ptdLastDecreaseDateTime' - The date and time of the last provisioned throughput decrease for this table.
--
-- * 'ptdWriteCapacityUnits' - The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a @ThrottlingException@ .
--
-- * 'ptdNumberOfDecreasesToday' - The number of provisioned throughput decreases for this table during this UTC calendar day. For current maximums on provisioned throughput decreases, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html Service, Account, and Table Quotas> in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'ptdLastIncreaseDateTime' - The date and time of the last provisioned throughput increase for this table.
