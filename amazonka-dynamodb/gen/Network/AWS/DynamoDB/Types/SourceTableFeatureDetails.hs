-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'stfdStreamDescription' - Stream settings on the table when the backup was created.
--
-- * 'stfdGlobalSecondaryIndexes' - Represents the GSI properties for the table when the backup was created. It includes the IndexName, KeySchema, Projection, and ProvisionedThroughput for the GSIs on the table at the time of backup.
