-- | Creates a value of 'BackupSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bsBackupExpiryDateTime' - Time at which the automatic on-demand backup created by DynamoDB will expire. This @SYSTEM@ on-demand backup expires automatically 35 days after its creation.
--
-- * 'bsTableARN' - ARN associated with the table.
--
-- * 'bsBackupName' - Name of the specified backup.
--
-- * 'bsBackupStatus' - Backup can be in one of the following states: CREATING, ACTIVE, DELETED.
--
-- * 'bsBackupSizeBytes' - Size of the backup in bytes.
--
-- * 'bsBackupARN' - ARN associated with the backup.
--
-- * 'bsTableId' - Unique identifier for the table.
--
-- * 'bsBackupCreationDateTime' - Time at which the backup was created.
--
-- * 'bsBackupType' - BackupType:     * @USER@ - You create and manage these using the on-demand backup feature.     * @SYSTEM@ - If you delete a table with point-in-time recovery enabled, a @SYSTEM@ backup is automatically created and is retained for 35 days (at no additional cost). System backups allow you to restore the deleted table to the state it was in just before the point of deletion.      * @AWS_BACKUP@ - On-demand backup created by you from AWS Backup service.
--
-- * 'bsTableName' - Name of the table.
