-- | Creates a value of 'APNSPushNotificationTemplate' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'apntRawContent' - The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for push notifications that are based on the message template. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message template.
--
-- * 'apntBody' - The message body to use in push notifications that are based on the message template.
--
-- * 'apntURL' - The URL to open in the recipient's default mobile browser, if a recipient taps a push notification that's based on the message template and the value of the Action property is URL.
--
-- * 'apntSound' - The key for the sound to play when the recipient receives a push notification that's based on the message template. The value for this key is the name of a sound file in your app's main bundle or the Library/Sounds folder in your app's data container. If the sound file can't be found or you specify default for the value, the system plays the default alert sound.
--
-- * 'apntAction' - The action to occur if a recipient taps a push notification that's based on the message template. Valid values are:     * OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background. This is the default action.     * DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a designated user interface in the app. This setting uses the deep-linking features of the iOS platform.     * URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's device opens and loads the web page at a URL that you specify.
--
-- * 'apntMediaURL' - The URL of an image or video to display in push notifications that are based on the message template.
--
-- * 'apntTitle' - The title to use in push notifications that are based on the message template. This title appears above the notification message on a recipient's device.
