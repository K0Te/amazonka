-- | Creates a value of 'BaiduChannelResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bcLastModifiedDate' - The date and time when the Baidu channel was last modified.
--
-- * 'bcEnabled' - Specifies whether the Baidu channel is enabled for the application.
--
-- * 'bcIsArchived' - Specifies whether the Baidu channel is archived.
--
-- * 'bcApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application that the Baidu channel applies to.
--
-- * 'bcVersion' - The current version of the Baidu channel.
--
-- * 'bcId' - (Deprecated) An identifier for the Baidu channel. This property is retained only for backward compatibility.
--
-- * 'bcCreationDate' - The date and time when the Baidu channel was enabled.
--
-- * 'bcLastModifiedBy' - The user who last modified the Baidu channel.
--
-- * 'bcHasCredential' - (Not used) This property is retained only for backward compatibility.
--
-- * 'bcCredential' - The API key that you received from the Baidu Cloud Push service to communicate with the service.
--
-- * 'bcPlatform' - The type of messaging or notification platform for the channel. For the Baidu channel, this value is BAIDU.
