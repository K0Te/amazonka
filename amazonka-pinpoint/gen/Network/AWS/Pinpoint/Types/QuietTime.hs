-- | Creates a value of 'QuietTime' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'qtStart' - The specific time when quiet time begins. This value has to use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.
--
-- * 'qtEnd' - The specific time when quiet time ends. This value has to use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.
