-- | Creates a value of 'SegmentResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sLastModifiedDate' - The date and time when the segment was last modified.
--
-- * 'sSegmentGroups' - A list of one or more segment groups that apply to the segment. Each segment group consists of zero or more base segments and the dimensions that are applied to those base segments.
--
-- * 'sName' - The name of the segment.
--
-- * 'sVersion' - The version number of the segment.
--
-- * 'sImportDefinition' - The settings for the import job that's associated with the segment.
--
-- * 'sDimensions' - The dimension settings for the segment.
--
-- * 'sTags' - A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags that are associated with the segment. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.
--
-- * 'sSegmentType' - The segment type. Valid values are:     * DIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint data that's reported by your app. Dynamic segments can change over time.     * IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint definitions that you import from a file. Imported segments are static; they don't change over time.
--
-- * 'sCreationDate' - The date and time when the segment was created.
--
-- * 'sId' - The unique identifier for the segment.
--
-- * 'sARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the segment.
--
-- * 'sApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application that the segment is associated with.
