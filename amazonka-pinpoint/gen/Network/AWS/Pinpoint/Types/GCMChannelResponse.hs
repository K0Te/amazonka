-- | Creates a value of 'GCMChannelResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gcLastModifiedDate' - The date and time when the GCM channel was last modified.
--
-- * 'gcEnabled' - Specifies whether the GCM channel is enabled for the application.
--
-- * 'gcIsArchived' - Specifies whether the GCM channel is archived.
--
-- * 'gcApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application that the GCM channel applies to.
--
-- * 'gcVersion' - The current version of the GCM channel.
--
-- * 'gcId' - (Deprecated) An identifier for the GCM channel. This property is retained only for backward compatibility.
--
-- * 'gcCreationDate' - The date and time when the GCM channel was enabled.
--
-- * 'gcLastModifiedBy' - The user who last modified the GCM channel.
--
-- * 'gcHasCredential' - (Not used) This property is retained only for backward compatibility.
--
-- * 'gcCredential' - The Web API Key, also referred to as an /API_KEY/ or /server key/ , that you received from Google to communicate with Google services.
--
-- * 'gcPlatform' - The type of messaging or notification platform for the channel. For the GCM channel, this value is GCM.
