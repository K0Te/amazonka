-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:

-- * 'mcsaBranches' - The paths for the activity, including the conditions for entering each path and the activity to perform for each path.
--
-- * 'mcsaEvaluationWaitTime' - The amount of time to wait or the date and time when Amazon Pinpoint determines whether the conditions are met.
