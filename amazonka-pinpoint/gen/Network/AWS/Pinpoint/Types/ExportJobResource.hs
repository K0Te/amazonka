-- | Provides information about the resource settings for a job that exports endpoint definitions to a file. The file can be added directly to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket by using the Amazon Pinpoint API or downloaded directly to a computer by using the Amazon Pinpoint console.

-- | Creates a value of 'ExportJobResource' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ejrSegmentId' - The identifier for the segment that the endpoint definitions were exported from. If this value isn't present, Amazon Pinpoint exported definitions for all the endpoints that are associated with the application.
--
-- * 'ejrSegmentVersion' - The version of the segment that the endpoint definitions were exported from.
--
-- * 'ejrS3URLPrefix' - The URL of the location in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where the endpoint definitions were exported to. This location is typically a folder that contains multiple files. The URL should be in the following format: s3://<replaceable>bucket-name/<replaceable>folder-name/.
--
-- * 'ejrRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorized Amazon Pinpoint to access the Amazon S3 location where the endpoint definitions were exported to.
