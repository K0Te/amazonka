-- | Creates a value of 'EventDimensions' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'edMetrics' - One or more custom metrics that your application reports to Amazon Pinpoint. You can use these metrics as selection criteria when you create an event filter.
--
-- * 'edEventType' - The name of the event that causes the campaign to be sent or the journey activity to be performed. This can be a standard event that Amazon Pinpoint generates, such as _email.delivered. For campaigns, this can also be a custom event that's specific to your application. For information about standard events, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/event-streams.html Streaming Amazon Pinpoint Events> in the /Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'edAttributes' - One or more custom attributes that your application reports to Amazon Pinpoint. You can use these attributes as selection criteria when you create an event filter.
