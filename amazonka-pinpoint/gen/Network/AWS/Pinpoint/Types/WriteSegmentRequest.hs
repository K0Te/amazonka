-- | Creates a value of 'WriteSegmentRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'wsrSegmentGroups' - The segment group to use and the dimensions to apply to the group's base segments in order to build the segment. A segment group can consist of zero or more base segments. Your request can include only one segment group.
--
-- * 'wsrName' - The name of the segment.
--
-- * 'wsrDimensions' - The criteria that define the dimensions for the segment.
--
-- * 'wsrTags' - A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the segment. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.
