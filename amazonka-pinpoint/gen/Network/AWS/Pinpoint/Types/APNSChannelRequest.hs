-- | Creates a value of 'APNSChannelRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'acrTokenKey' - The authentication key to use for APNs tokens.
--
-- * 'acrPrivateKey' - The private key for the APNs client certificate that you want Amazon Pinpoint to use to communicate with APNs.
--
-- * 'acrEnabled' - Specifies whether to enable the APNs channel for the application.
--
-- * 'acrTeamId' - The identifier that's assigned to your Apple developer account team. This identifier is used for APNs tokens.
--
-- * 'acrBundleId' - The bundle identifier that's assigned to your iOS app. This identifier is used for APNs tokens.
--
-- * 'acrDefaultAuthenticationMethod' - The default authentication method that you want Amazon Pinpoint to use when authenticating with APNs, key or certificate.
--
-- * 'acrCertificate' - The APNs client certificate that you received from Apple, if you want Amazon Pinpoint to communicate with APNs by using an APNs certificate.
--
-- * 'acrTokenKeyId' - The key identifier that's assigned to your APNs signing key, if you want Amazon Pinpoint to communicate with APNs by using APNs tokens.
