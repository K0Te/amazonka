-- | Creates a value of 'EndpointMessageResult' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'emrAddress' - The endpoint address that the message was delivered to.
--
-- * 'emrStatusMessage' - The status message for delivering the message.
--
-- * 'emrUpdatedToken' - For push notifications that are sent through the GCM channel, specifies whether the endpoint's device registration token was updated as part of delivering the message.
--
-- * 'emrMessageId' - The unique identifier for the message that was sent.
--
-- * 'emrDeliveryStatus' - The delivery status of the message. Possible values are:     * DUPLICATE - The endpoint address is a duplicate of another endpoint address. Amazon Pinpoint won't attempt to send the message again.     * OPT_OUT - The user who's associated with the endpoint has opted out of receiving messages from you. Amazon Pinpoint won't attempt to send the message again.     * PERMANENT_FAILURE - An error occurred when delivering the message to the endpoint. Amazon Pinpoint won't attempt to send the message again.     * SUCCESSFUL - The message was successfully delivered to the endpoint.     * TEMPORARY_FAILURE - A temporary error occurred. Amazon Pinpoint won't attempt to send the message again.     * THROTTLED - Amazon Pinpoint throttled the operation to send the message to the endpoint.     * TIMEOUT - The message couldn't be sent within the timeout period.     * UNKNOWN_FAILURE - An unknown error occurred.
--
-- * 'emrStatusCode' - The downstream service status code for delivering the message.
