-- | Creates a value of 'Activity' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aConditionalSplit' - The settings for a yes/no split activity. This type of activity sends participants down one of two paths in a journey, based on conditions that you specify.
--
-- * 'aEMAIL' - The settings for an email activity. This type of activity sends an email message to participants.
--
-- * 'aMultiCondition' - The settings for a multivariate split activity. This type of activity sends participants down one of as many as five paths (including a default /Else/ path) in a journey, based on conditions that you specify.
--
-- * 'aCUSTOM' - The settings for a custom message activity. This type of activity calls an AWS Lambda function or web hook that sends messages to participants.
--
-- * 'aWait' - The settings for a wait activity. This type of activity waits for a certain amount of time or until a specific date and time before moving participants to the next activity in a journey.
--
-- * 'aRandomSplit' - The settings for a random split activity. This type of activity randomly sends specified percentages of participants down one of as many as five paths in a journey, based on conditions that you specify.
--
-- * 'aHoldout' - The settings for a holdout activity. This type of activity stops a journey for a specified percentage of participants.
--
-- * 'aSMS' - The settings for an SMS activity. This type of activity sends a text message to participants.
--
-- * 'aPUSH' - The settings for a push notification activity. This type of activity sends a push notification to participants.
--
-- * 'aDescription' - The custom description of the activity.
