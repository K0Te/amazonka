-- | Creates a value of 'HoldoutActivity' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'haNextActivity' - The unique identifier for the next activity to perform, after performing the holdout activity.
--
-- * 'haPercentage' - The percentage of participants who shouldn't continue the journey. To determine which participants are held out, Amazon Pinpoint applies a probability-based algorithm to the percentage that you specify. Therefore, the actual percentage of participants who are held out may not be equal to the percentage that you specify.
