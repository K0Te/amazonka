-- | Creates a value of 'AndroidPushNotificationTemplate' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aImageIconURL' - The URL of the large icon image to display in the content view of a push notification that's based on the message template.
--
-- * 'aRawContent' - The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for a push notification that's based on the message template. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message template.
--
-- * 'aSmallImageIconURL' - The URL of the small icon image to display in the status bar and the content view of a push notification that's based on the message template.
--
-- * 'aBody' - The message body to use in a push notification that's based on the message template.
--
-- * 'aURL' - The URL to open in a recipient's default mobile browser, if a recipient taps a push notification that's based on the message template and the value of the Action property is URL.
--
-- * 'aSound' - The sound to play when a recipient receives a push notification that's based on the message template. You can use the default stream or specify the file name of a sound resource that's bundled in your app. On an Android platform, the sound file must reside in /res/raw/.
--
-- * 'aAction' - The action to occur if a recipient taps a push notification that's based on the message template. Valid values are:     * OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background. This is the default action.     * DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a designated user interface in the app. This action uses the deep-linking features of the Android platform.     * URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's device opens and loads the web page at a URL that you specify.
--
-- * 'aImageURL' - The URL of an image to display in a push notification that's based on the message template.
--
-- * 'aTitle' - The title to use in a push notification that's based on the message template. This title appears above the notification message on a recipient's device.
