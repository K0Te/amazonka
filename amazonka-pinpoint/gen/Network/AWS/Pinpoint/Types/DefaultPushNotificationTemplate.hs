-- | Creates a value of 'DefaultPushNotificationTemplate' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dpntBody' - The message body to use in push notifications that are based on the message template.
--
-- * 'dpntURL' - The URL to open in a recipient's default mobile browser, if a recipient taps a push notification that's based on the message template and the value of the Action property is URL.
--
-- * 'dpntSound' - The sound to play when a recipient receives a push notification that's based on the message template. You can use the default stream or specify the file name of a sound resource that's bundled in your app. On an Android platform, the sound file must reside in /res/raw/. For an iOS platform, this value is the key for the name of a sound file in your app's main bundle or the Library/Sounds folder in your app's data container. If the sound file can't be found or you specify default for the value, the system plays the default alert sound.
--
-- * 'dpntAction' - The action to occur if a recipient taps a push notification that's based on the message template. Valid values are:     * OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background. This is the default action.     * DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a designated user interface in the app. This setting uses the deep-linking features of the iOS and Android platforms.     * URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's device opens and loads the web page at a URL that you specify.
--
-- * 'dpntTitle' - The title to use in push notifications that are based on the message template. This title appears above the notification message on a recipient's device.
