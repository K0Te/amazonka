-- | Creates a value of 'ExportJobResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ejCompletedPieces' - The number of pieces that were processed successfully (completed) by the export job, as of the time of the request.
--
-- * 'ejFailedPieces' - The number of pieces that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the export job, as of the time of the request.
--
-- * 'ejTotalProcessed' - The total number of endpoint definitions that were processed by the export job.
--
-- * 'ejFailures' - An array of entries, one for each of the first 100 entries that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the export job, if any.
--
-- * 'ejTotalPieces' - The total number of pieces that must be processed to complete the export job. Each piece consists of an approximately equal portion of the endpoint definitions that are part of the export job.
--
-- * 'ejCompletionDate' - The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the export job was completed.
--
-- * 'ejTotalFailures' - The total number of endpoint definitions that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the export job, typically because an error, such as a syntax error, occurred.
--
-- * 'ejJobStatus' - The status of the export job. The job status is FAILED if Amazon Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces in the job.
--
-- * 'ejCreationDate' - The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the export job was created.
--
-- * 'ejType' - The job type. This value is EXPORT for export jobs.
--
-- * 'ejDefinition' - The resource settings that apply to the export job.
--
-- * 'ejId' - The unique identifier for the export job.
--
-- * 'ejApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application that's associated with the export job.
