-- | Creates a value of 'ActivityResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aState' - The current status of the activity. Possible values are: PENDING, INITIALIZING, RUNNING, PAUSED, CANCELLED, and COMPLETED.
--
-- * 'aStart' - The actual start time, in ISO 8601 format, of the activity.
--
-- * 'aTimezonesCompletedCount' - The total number of time zones that were completed.
--
-- * 'aTimezonesTotalCount' - The total number of unique time zones that are in the segment for the campaign.
--
-- * 'aResult' - Specifies whether the activity succeeded. Possible values are SUCCESS and FAIL.
--
-- * 'aTreatmentId' - The unique identifier for the campaign treatment that the activity applies to. A treatment is a variation of a campaign that's used for A/B testing of a campaign.
--
-- * 'aSuccessfulEndpointCount' - The total number of endpoints that the campaign successfully delivered messages to.
--
-- * 'aEnd' - The actual time, in ISO 8601 format, when the activity was marked CANCELLED or COMPLETED.
--
-- * 'aTotalEndpointCount' - The total number of endpoints that the campaign attempted to deliver messages to.
--
-- * 'aScheduledStart' - The scheduled start time, in ISO 8601 format, for the activity.
--
-- * 'aCampaignId' - The unique identifier for the campaign that the activity applies to.
--
-- * 'aId' - The unique identifier for the activity.
--
-- * 'aApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application that the campaign applies to.
