-- | Creates a value of 'EmailMessage' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'emSubstitutions' - The default message variables to use in the email message. You can override the default variables with individual address variables.
--
-- * 'emBody' - The body of the email message.
--
-- * 'emFromAddress' - The verified email address to send the email message from. The default value is the FromAddress specified for the email channel.
--
-- * 'emRawEmail' - The email message, represented as a raw MIME message.
--
-- * 'emFeedbackForwardingAddress' - The email address to forward bounces and complaints to, if feedback forwarding is enabled.
--
-- * 'emSimpleEmail' - The email message, composed of a subject, a text part, and an HTML part.
--
-- * 'emReplyToAddresses' - The reply-to email address(es) for the email message. If a recipient replies to the email, each reply-to address receives the reply.
