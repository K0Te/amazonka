-- | Creates a value of 'WriteCampaignRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'wcrCustomDeliveryConfiguration' - The delivery configuration settings for sending the campaign through a custom channel. This object is required if the MessageConfiguration object for the campaign specifies a CustomMessage object.
--
-- * 'wcrSchedule' - The schedule settings for the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrTemplateConfiguration' - The message template to use for the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrHook' - The settings for the AWS Lambda function to invoke as a code hook for the campaign. You can use this hook to customize the segment that's used by the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrTreatmentName' - A custom name of the default treatment for the campaign, if the campaign has multiple treatments. A /treatment/ is a variation of a campaign that's used for A/B testing.
--
-- * 'wcrLimits' - The messaging limits for the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrIsPaused' - Specifies whether to pause the campaign. A paused campaign doesn't run unless you resume it by changing this value to false.
--
-- * 'wcrName' - A custom name for the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrHoldoutPercent' - The allocated percentage of users (segment members) who shouldn't receive messages from the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrTreatmentDescription' - A custom description of the default treatment for the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrMessageConfiguration' - The message configuration settings for the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrDescription' - A custom description of the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrSegmentId' - The unique identifier for the segment to associate with the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrAdditionalTreatments' - An array of requests that defines additional treatments for the campaign, in addition to the default treatment for the campaign.
--
-- * 'wcrTags' - A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the campaign. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.
--
-- * 'wcrSegmentVersion' - The version of the segment to associate with the campaign.
