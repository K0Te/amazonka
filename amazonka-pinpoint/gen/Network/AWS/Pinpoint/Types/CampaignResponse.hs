-- | Creates a value of 'CampaignResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cCustomDeliveryConfiguration' - The delivery configuration settings for sending the campaign through a custom channel.
--
-- * 'cState' - The current status of the campaign.
--
-- * 'cSchedule' - The schedule settings for the campaign.
--
-- * 'cTemplateConfiguration' - The message template that’s used for the campaign.
--
-- * 'cHook' - The settings for the AWS Lambda function to use as a code hook for the campaign. You can use this hook to customize the segment that's used by the campaign.
--
-- * 'cTreatmentName' - The custom name of the default treatment for the campaign, if the campaign has multiple treatments. A /treatment/ is a variation of a campaign that's used for A/B testing.
--
-- * 'cLimits' - The messaging limits for the campaign.
--
-- * 'cIsPaused' - Specifies whether the campaign is paused. A paused campaign doesn't run unless you resume it by changing this value to false.
--
-- * 'cDefaultState' - The current status of the campaign's default treatment. This value exists only for campaigns that have more than one treatment.
--
-- * 'cName' - The name of the campaign.
--
-- * 'cVersion' - The version number of the campaign.
--
-- * 'cHoldoutPercent' - The allocated percentage of users (segment members) who shouldn't receive messages from the campaign.
--
-- * 'cTreatmentDescription' - The custom description of the default treatment for the campaign.
--
-- * 'cMessageConfiguration' - The message configuration settings for the campaign.
--
-- * 'cDescription' - The custom description of the campaign.
--
-- * 'cAdditionalTreatments' - An array of responses, one for each treatment that you defined for the campaign, in addition to the default treatment.
--
-- * 'cTags' - A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags that are associated with the campaign. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.
--
-- * 'cLastModifiedDate' - The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the campaign was last modified.
--
-- * 'cCreationDate' - The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the campaign was created.
--
-- * 'cSegmentId' - The unique identifier for the segment that's associated with the campaign.
--
-- * 'cSegmentVersion' - The version number of the segment that's associated with the campaign.
--
-- * 'cId' - The unique identifier for the campaign.
--
-- * 'cARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign.
--
-- * 'cApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application that the campaign applies to.
