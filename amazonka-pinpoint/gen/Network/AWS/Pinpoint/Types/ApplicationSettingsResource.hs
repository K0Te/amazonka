-- | Creates a value of 'ApplicationSettingsResource' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'asrLastModifiedDate' - The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the application's settings were last modified.
--
-- * 'asrLimits' - The default sending limits for campaigns in the application.
--
-- * 'asrQuietTime' - The default quiet time for campaigns in the application. Quiet time is a specific time range when messages aren't sent to endpoints, if all the following conditions are met:     * The EndpointDemographic.Timezone property of the endpoint is set to a valid value.     * The current time in the endpoint's time zone is later than or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.Start property for the application (or a campaign or journey that has custom quiet time settings).     * The current time in the endpoint's time zone is earlier than or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.End property for the application (or a campaign or journey that has custom quiet time settings). If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the endpoint will receive messages from a campaign or journey, even if quiet time is enabled.
--
-- * 'asrCampaignHook' - The settings for the AWS Lambda function to invoke by default as a code hook for campaigns in the application. You can use this hook to customize segments that are used by campaigns in the application.
--
-- * 'asrApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application. This identifier is displayed as the __Project ID__ on the Amazon Pinpoint console.
