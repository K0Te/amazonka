-- * 'csaEvaluationWaitTime' - The amount of time to wait before determining whether the conditions are met, or the date and time when Amazon Pinpoint determines whether the conditions are met.

--
-- * 'csaFalseActivity' - The unique identifier for the activity to perform if the conditions aren't met.
