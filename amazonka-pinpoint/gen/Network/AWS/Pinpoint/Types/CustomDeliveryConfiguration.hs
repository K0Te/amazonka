-- | Creates a value of 'CustomDeliveryConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cdcEndpointTypes' - The types of endpoints to send the campaign or treatment to. Each valid value maps to a type of channel that you can associate with an endpoint by using the ChannelType property of an endpoint.
--
-- * 'cdcDeliveryURI' - The destination to send the campaign or treatment to. This value can be one of the following:     * The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function to invoke to handle delivery of the campaign or treatment.     * The URL for a web application or service that supports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.
