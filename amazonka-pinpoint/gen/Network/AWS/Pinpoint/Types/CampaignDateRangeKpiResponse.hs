-- | Creates a value of 'CampaignDateRangeKpiResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cdrkNextToken' - The string to use in a subsequent request to get the next page of results in a paginated response. This value is null for the Campaign Metrics resource because the resource returns all results in a single page.
--
-- * 'cdrkKpiResult' - An array of objects that contains the results of the query. Each object contains the value for the metric and metadata about that value.
--
-- * 'cdrkKpiName' - The name of the metric, also referred to as a /key performance indicator (KPI)/ , that the data was retrieved for. This value describes the associated metric and consists of two or more terms, which are comprised of lowercase alphanumeric characters, separated by a hyphen. For a list of possible values, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/analytics-standard-metrics.html Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide> .
--
-- * 'cdrkEndTime' - The last date and time of the date range that was used to filter the query results, in extended ISO 8601 format. The date range is inclusive.
--
-- * 'cdrkCampaignId' - The unique identifier for the campaign that the metric applies to.
--
-- * 'cdrkStartTime' - The first date and time of the date range that was used to filter the query results, in extended ISO 8601 format. The date range is inclusive.
--
-- * 'cdrkApplicationId' - The unique identifier for the application that the metric applies to.
