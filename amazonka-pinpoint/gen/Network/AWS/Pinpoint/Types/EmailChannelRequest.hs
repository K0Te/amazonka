-- | Creates a value of 'EmailChannelRequest' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ecrEnabled' - Specifies whether to enable the email channel for the application.
--
-- * 'ecrConfigurationSet' - The <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_ConfigurationSet.html Amazon SES configuration set> that you want to apply to messages that you send through the channel.
--
-- * 'ecrRoleARN' - The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want Amazon Pinpoint to use when it submits email-related event data for the channel.
--
-- * 'ecrFromAddress' - The verified email address that you want to send email from when you send email through the channel.
--
-- * 'ecrIdentity' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the identity, verified with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), that you want to use when you send email through the channel.
