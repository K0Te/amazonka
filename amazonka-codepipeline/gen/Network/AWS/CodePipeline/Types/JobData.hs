-- | Creates a value of 'JobData' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jdContinuationToken' - A system-generated token, such as a AWS CodeDeploy deployment ID, required by a job to continue the job asynchronously.
--
-- * 'jdOutputArtifacts' - The output of the job.
--
-- * 'jdArtifactCredentials' - Represents an AWS session credentials object. These credentials are temporary credentials that are issued by AWS Secure Token Service (STS). They can be used to access input and output artifacts in the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.
--
-- * 'jdPipelineContext' - Represents information about a pipeline to a job worker.
--
-- * 'jdEncryptionKey' - Represents information about the key used to encrypt data in the artifact store, such as an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. 
--
-- * 'jdActionTypeId' - Represents information about an action type.
--
-- * 'jdInputArtifacts' - The artifact supplied to the job.
--
-- * 'jdActionConfiguration' - Represents information about an action configuration.
