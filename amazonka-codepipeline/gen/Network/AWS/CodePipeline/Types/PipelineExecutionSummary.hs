-- | Creates a value of 'PipelineExecutionSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pesStatus' - The status of the pipeline execution.     * InProgress: The pipeline execution is currently running.     * Stopped: The pipeline execution was manually stopped. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-executions-stopped Stopped Executions> .     * Stopping: The pipeline execution received a request to be manually stopped. Depending on the selected stop mode, the execution is either completing or abandoning in-progress actions. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-executions-stopped Stopped Executions> .     * Succeeded: The pipeline execution was completed successfully.      * Superseded: While this pipeline execution was waiting for the next stage to be completed, a newer pipeline execution advanced and continued through the pipeline instead. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-superseded Superseded Executions> .     * Failed: The pipeline execution was not completed successfully.
--
-- * 'pesStartTime' - The date and time when the pipeline execution began, in timestamp format.
--
-- * 'pesStopTrigger' - The interaction that stopped a pipeline execution.
--
-- * 'pesPipelineExecutionId' - The ID of the pipeline execution.
--
-- * 'pesSourceRevisions' - A list of the source artifact revisions that initiated a pipeline execution.
--
-- * 'pesTrigger' - The interaction or event that started a pipeline execution, such as automated change detection or a @StartPipelineExecution@ API call.
--
-- * 'pesLastUpdateTime' - The date and time of the last change to the pipeline execution, in timestamp format.
