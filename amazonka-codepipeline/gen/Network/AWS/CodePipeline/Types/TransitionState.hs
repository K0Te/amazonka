-- | Creates a value of 'TransitionState' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tsEnabled' - Whether the transition between stages is enabled (true) or disabled (false).
--
-- * 'tsDisabledReason' - The user-specified reason why the transition between two stages of a pipeline was disabled.
--
-- * 'tsLastChangedAt' - The timestamp when the transition state was last changed.
--
-- * 'tsLastChangedBy' - The ID of the user who last changed the transition state.
