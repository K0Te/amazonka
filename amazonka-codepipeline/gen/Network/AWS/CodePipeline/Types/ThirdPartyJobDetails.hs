-- | Creates a value of 'ThirdPartyJobDetails' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tpjdData' - The data to be returned by the third party job worker.
--
-- * 'tpjdId' - The identifier used to identify the job details in AWS CodePipeline.
--
-- * 'tpjdNonce' - A system-generated random number that AWS CodePipeline uses to ensure that the job is being worked on by only one job worker. Use this number in an 'AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob' request.
