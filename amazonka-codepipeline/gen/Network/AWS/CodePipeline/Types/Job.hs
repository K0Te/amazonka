-- | Creates a value of 'Job' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'jData' - Other data about a job.
--
-- * 'jAccountId' - The ID of the AWS account to use when performing the job.
--
-- * 'jId' - The unique system-generated ID of the job.
--
-- * 'jNonce' - A system-generated random number that AWS CodePipeline uses to ensure that the job is being worked on by only one job worker. Use this number in an 'AcknowledgeJob' request.
