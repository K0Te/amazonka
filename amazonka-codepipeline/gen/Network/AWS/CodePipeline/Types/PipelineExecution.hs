-- | Creates a value of 'PipelineExecution' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'peStatus' - The status of the pipeline execution.     * InProgress: The pipeline execution is currently running.     * Stopped: The pipeline execution was manually stopped. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-executions-stopped Stopped Executions> .     * Stopping: The pipeline execution received a request to be manually stopped. Depending on the selected stop mode, the execution is either completing or abandoning in-progress actions. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-executions-stopped Stopped Executions> .     * Succeeded: The pipeline execution was completed successfully.      * Superseded: While this pipeline execution was waiting for the next stage to be completed, a newer pipeline execution advanced and continued through the pipeline instead. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-superseded Superseded Executions> .     * Failed: The pipeline execution was not completed successfully.
--
-- * 'pePipelineName' - The name of the pipeline with the specified pipeline execution.
--
-- * 'pePipelineVersion' - The version number of the pipeline with the specified pipeline execution.
--
-- * 'pePipelineExecutionId' - The ID of the pipeline execution.
--
-- * 'peArtifactRevisions' - A list of @ArtifactRevision@ objects included in a pipeline execution.
