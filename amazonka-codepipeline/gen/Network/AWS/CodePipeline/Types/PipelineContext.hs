-- | Creates a value of 'PipelineContext' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pcStage' - The stage of the pipeline.
--
-- * 'pcPipelineName' - The name of the pipeline. This is a user-specified value. Pipeline names must be unique across all pipeline names under an Amazon Web Services account.
--
-- * 'pcAction' - The context of an action to a job worker in the stage of a pipeline.
--
-- * 'pcPipelineARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline.
--
-- * 'pcPipelineExecutionId' - The execution ID of the pipeline.
