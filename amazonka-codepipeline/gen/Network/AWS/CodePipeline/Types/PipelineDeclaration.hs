-- | Creates a value of 'PipelineDeclaration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pdArtifactStores' - A mapping of @artifactStore@ objects and their corresponding AWS Regions. There must be an artifact store for the pipeline Region and for each cross-region action in the pipeline.
--
-- * 'pdArtifactStore' - Represents information about the S3 bucket where artifacts are stored for the pipeline.
--
-- * 'pdVersion' - The version number of the pipeline. A new pipeline always has a version number of 1. This number is incremented when a pipeline is updated.
--
-- * 'pdName' - The name of the pipeline.
--
-- * 'pdRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for AWS CodePipeline to use to either perform actions with no @actionRoleArn@ , or to use to assume roles for actions with an @actionRoleArn@ .
--
-- * 'pdStages' - The stage in which to perform the action.
