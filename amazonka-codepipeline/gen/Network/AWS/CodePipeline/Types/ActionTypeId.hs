-- | Creates a value of 'ActionTypeId' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'atiCategory' - A category defines what kind of action can be taken in the stage, and constrains the provider type for the action. Valid categories are limited to one of the following values.      * Source     * Build     * Test     * Deploy     * Invoke     * Approval
--
-- * 'atiOwner' - The creator of the action being called. There are three valid values for the @Owner@ field in the action category section within your pipeline structure: @AWS@ , @ThirdParty@ , and @Custom@ . For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#actions-valid-providers Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline> .
--
-- * 'atiProvider' - The provider of the service being called by the action. Valid providers are determined by the action category. For example, an action in the Deploy category type might have a provider of AWS CodeDeploy, which would be specified as CodeDeploy. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#actions-valid-providers Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline> .
--
-- * 'atiVersion' - A string that describes the action version.
