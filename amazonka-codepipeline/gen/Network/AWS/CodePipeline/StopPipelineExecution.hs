-- Stops the specified pipeline execution. You choose to either stop the pipeline execution by completing in-progress actions without starting subsequent actions, or by abandoning in-progress actions. While completing or abandoning in-progress actions, the pipeline execution is in a @Stopping@ state. After all in-progress actions are completed or abandoned, the pipeline execution is in a @Stopped@ state.
