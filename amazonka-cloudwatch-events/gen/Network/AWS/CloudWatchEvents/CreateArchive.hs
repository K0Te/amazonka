-- Creates an archive of events with the specified settings. When you create an archive, incoming events might not immediately start being sent to the archive. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. If you do not specify a pattern to filter events sent to the archive, all events are sent to the archive except replayed events. Replayed events are not sent to an archive.
