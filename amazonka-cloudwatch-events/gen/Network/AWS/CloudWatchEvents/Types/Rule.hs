-- | Creates a value of 'Rule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rEventPattern' - The event pattern of the rule. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-and-event-patterns.html Events and Event Patterns> in the /Amazon EventBridge User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'rState' - The state of the rule.
--
-- * 'rARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.
--
-- * 'rEventBusName' - The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If you omit this, the default event bus is used.
--
-- * 'rScheduleExpression' - The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ? *)", "rate(5 minutes)".
--
-- * 'rName' - The name of the rule.
--
-- * 'rDescription' - The description of the rule.
--
-- * 'rManagedBy' - If the rule was created on behalf of your account by an AWS service, this field displays the principal name of the service that created the rule.
--
-- * 'rRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that is used for target invocation.
