-- | Creates a value of 'Replay' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'repEventSourceARN' - The ARN of the archive to replay event from.
--
-- * 'repState' - The current state of the replay.
--
-- * 'repEventEndTime' - A time stamp for the time to start replaying events. Any event with a creation time prior to the @EventEndTime@ specified is replayed.
--
-- * 'repReplayStartTime' - A time stamp for the time that the replay started.
--
-- * 'repReplayEndTime' - A time stamp for the time that the replay completed.
--
-- * 'repEventLastReplayedTime' - A time stamp for the time that the last event was replayed.
--
-- * 'repEventStartTime' - A time stamp for the time to start replaying events. This is determined by the time in the event as described in <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutEventsRequestEntry.html#eventbridge-Type-PutEventsRequestEntry-Time Time> .
--
-- * 'repReplayName' - The name of the replay.
--
-- * 'repStateReason' - A description of why the replay is in the current state.
