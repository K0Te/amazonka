-- | Creates a value of 'PutEventsRequestEntry' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pereTime' - The time stamp of the event, per <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt RFC3339> . If no time stamp is provided, the time stamp of the 'PutEvents' call is used.
--
-- * 'pereDetailType' - Free-form string used to decide what fields to expect in the event detail.
--
-- * 'pereResources' - AWS resources, identified by Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which the event primarily concerns. Any number, including zero, may be present.
--
-- * 'pereEventBusName' - The name or ARN of the event bus to receive the event. Only the rules that are associated with this event bus are used to match the event. If you omit this, the default event bus is used.
--
-- * 'pereSource' - The source of the event.
--
-- * 'pereDetail' - A valid JSON string. There is no other schema imposed. The JSON string may contain fields and nested subobjects.
