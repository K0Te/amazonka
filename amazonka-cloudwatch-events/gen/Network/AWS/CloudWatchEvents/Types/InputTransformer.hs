-- | Creates a value of 'InputTransformer' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'itInputPathsMap' - Map of JSON paths to be extracted from the event. You can then insert these in the template in @InputTemplate@ to produce the output you want to be sent to the target. @InputPathsMap@ is an array key-value pairs, where each value is a valid JSON path. You can have as many as 10 key-value pairs. You must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. The keys cannot start with "AWS." 
--
-- * 'itInputTemplate' - Input template where you specify placeholders that will be filled with the values of the keys from @InputPathsMap@ to customize the data sent to the target. Enclose each @InputPathsMaps@ value in brackets: </value/ > The InputTemplate must be valid JSON. If @InputTemplate@ is a JSON object (surrounded by curly braces), the following restrictions apply:     * The placeholder cannot be used as an object key.     * Object values cannot include quote marks. The following example shows the syntax for using @InputPathsMap@ and @InputTemplate@ . @"InputTransformer":@  @{@  @"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},@  @"InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state <status>"@  @}@  To have the @InputTemplate@ include quote marks within a JSON string, escape each quote marks with a slash, as in the following example: @"InputTransformer":@  @{@  @"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},@  @"InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state \"<status>\""@  @}@
