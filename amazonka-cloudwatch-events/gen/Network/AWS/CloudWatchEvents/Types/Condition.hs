-- | A JSON string which you can use to limit the event bus permissions you are granting to only accounts that fulfill the condition. Currently, the only supported condition is membership in a certain AWS organization. The string must contain @Type@ , @Key@ , and @Value@ fields. The @Value@ field specifies the ID of the AWS organization. Following is an example value for @Condition@ :
--
--
-- @'{"Type" : "StringEquals", "Key": "aws:PrincipalOrgID", "Value": "o-1234567890"}'@ 
--
--
-- /See:/ 'condition' smart constructor.

-- | Creates a value of 'Condition' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cType' - Specifies the type of condition. Currently the only supported value is @StringEquals@ .
--
-- * 'cKey' - Specifies the key for the condition. Currently the only supported key is @aws:PrincipalOrgID@ .
--
-- * 'cValue' - Specifies the value for the key. Currently, this must be the ID of the organization.
