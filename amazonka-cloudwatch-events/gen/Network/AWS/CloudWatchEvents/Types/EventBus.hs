-- | An event bus receives events from a source and routes them to rules associated with that event bus. Your account's default event bus receives rules from AWS services. A custom event bus can receive rules from AWS services as well as your custom applications and services. A partner event bus receives events from an event source created by an SaaS partner. These events come from the partners services or applications.
