-- | Creates a value of 'Archive' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'aCreationTime' - The time stamp for the time that the archive was created.
--
-- * 'aSizeBytes' - The size of the archive, in bytes.
--
-- * 'aEventSourceARN' - The ARN of the event bus associated with the archive. Only events from this event bus are sent to the archive.
--
-- * 'aState' - The current state of the archive.
--
-- * 'aEventCount' - The number of events in the archive.
--
-- * 'aArchiveName' - The name of the archive.
--
-- * 'aRetentionDays' - The number of days to retain events in the archive before they are deleted.
--
-- * 'aStateReason' - A description for the reason that the archive is in the current state.
