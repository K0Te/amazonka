-- | Creates a value of 'PartnerEventSourceAccount' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pesaCreationTime' - The date and time the event source was created.
--
-- * 'pesaState' - The state of the event source. If it is ACTIVE, you have already created a matching event bus for this event source, and that event bus is active. If it is PENDING, either you haven't yet created a matching event bus, or that event bus is deactivated. If it is DELETED, you have created a matching event bus, but the event source has since been deleted.
--
-- * 'pesaAccount' - The AWS account ID that the partner event source was offered to.
--
-- * 'pesaExpirationTime' - The date and time that the event source will expire, if the AWS account doesn't create a matching event bus for it.
