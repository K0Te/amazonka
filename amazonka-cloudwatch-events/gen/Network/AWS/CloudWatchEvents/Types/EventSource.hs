-- | Creates a value of 'EventSource' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'esCreationTime' - The date and time the event source was created.
--
-- * 'esState' - The state of the event source. If it is ACTIVE, you have already created a matching event bus for this event source, and that event bus is active. If it is PENDING, either you haven't yet created a matching event bus, or that event bus is deactivated. If it is DELETED, you have created a matching event bus, but the event source has since been deleted.
--
-- * 'esARN' - The ARN of the event source.
--
-- * 'esCreatedBy' - The name of the partner that created the event source.
--
-- * 'esName' - The name of the event source.
--
-- * 'esExpirationTime' - The date and time that the event source will expire, if the AWS account doesn't create a matching event bus for it.
