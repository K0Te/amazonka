-- Running @PutPermission@ permits the specified AWS account or AWS organization to put events to the specified /event bus/ . Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to an event bus in your account. 
--
--
-- For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus as a target.
--
-- To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your event bus, run @PutPermission@ once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same AWS organization, you can run @PutPermission@ once specifying @Principal@ as "*" and specifying the AWS organization ID in @Condition@ , to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.
--
-- If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a @RoleArn@ with proper permissions when they use @PutTarget@ to add your account's event bus as a target. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts> in the /Amazon EventBridge User Guide/ .
--
-- The permission policy on the default event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.

-- | Creates a value of 'PutPermission' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ppAction' - The action that you are enabling the other account to perform. Currently, this must be @events:PutEvents@ .
--
-- * 'ppEventBusName' - The name of the event bus associated with the rule. If you omit this, the default event bus is used.
--
-- * 'ppPrincipal' - The 12-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus. If you specify "*" without specifying @Condition@ , avoid creating rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an @account@ field with a specific account ID from which to receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other accounts.
--
-- * 'ppPolicy' - A JSON string that describes the permission policy statement. You can include a @Policy@ parameter in the request instead of using the @StatementId@ , @Action@ , @Principal@ , or @Condition@ parameters.
--
-- * 'ppStatementId' - An identifier string for the external account that you are granting permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account, specify this @StatementId@ when you run 'RemovePermission' .
--
-- * 'ppCondition' - This parameter enables you to limit the permission to accounts that fulfill a certain condition, such as being a member of a certain AWS organization. For more information about AWS Organizations, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html What Is AWS Organizations> in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/ . If you specify @Condition@ with an AWS organization ID, and specify "*" as the value for @Principal@ , you grant permission to all the accounts in the named organization. The @Condition@ is a JSON string which must contain @Type@ , @Key@ , and @Value@ fields.
