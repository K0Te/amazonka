module Network.AWS.Rekognition.Types.BoundingBox where

import Network.AWS.Lens
import Network.AWS.Prelude

-- | Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text or personal protective equipment. The @left@ (x-coordinate) and @top@ (y-coordinate) are coordinates representing the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0). 
--
--
-- The @top@ and @left@ values returned are ratios of the overall image size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API returns a @left@ value of 0.5 (350/700) and a @top@ value of 0.25 (50/200).
--
-- The @width@ and @height@ values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.
