-- | Information about a word or line of text detected by 'DetectText' .
--
--
-- The @DetectedText@ field contains the text that Amazon Rekognition detected in the image. 
--
-- Every word and line has an identifier (@Id@ ). Each word belongs to a line and has a parent identifier (@ParentId@ ) that identifies the line of text in which the word appears. The word @Id@ is also an index for the word within a line of words. 
--
-- For more information, see Detecting Text in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

-- | Creates a value of 'TextDetection' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tdDetectedText' - The word or line of text recognized by Amazon Rekognition. 
--
-- * 'tdConfidence' - The confidence that Amazon Rekognition has in the accuracy of the detected text and the accuracy of the geometry points around the detected text.
--
-- * 'tdGeometry' - The location of the detected text on the image. Includes an axis aligned coarse bounding box surrounding the text and a finer grain polygon for more accurate spatial information.
--
-- * 'tdId' - The identifier for the detected text. The identifier is only unique for a single call to @DetectText@ . 
--
-- * 'tdType' - The type of text that was detected.
--
-- * 'tdParentId' - The Parent identifier for the detected text identified by the value of @ID@ . If the type of detected text is @LINE@ , the value of @ParentId@ is @Null@ .
