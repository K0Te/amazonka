-- | Creates a value of 'TestingDataResult' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tdrInput' - The testing dataset that was supplied for training.
--
-- * 'tdrOutput' - The subset of the dataset that was actually tested. Some images (assets) might not be tested due to file formatting and other issues. 
--
-- * 'tdrValidation' - The location of the data validation manifest. The data validation manifest is created for the test dataset during model training.
