-- | Creates a value of 'DetectionFilter' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dfMinBoundingBoxHeight' - Sets the minimum height of the word bounding box. Words with bounding box heights lesser than this value will be excluded from the result. Value is relative to the video frame height.
--
-- * 'dfMinBoundingBoxWidth' - Sets the minimum width of the word bounding box. Words with bounding boxes widths lesser than this value will be excluded from the result. Value is relative to the video frame width.
--
-- * 'dfMinConfidence' - Sets confidence of word detection. Words with detection confidence below this will be excluded from the result. Values should be between 0.5 and 1 as Text in Video will not return any result below 0.5.
