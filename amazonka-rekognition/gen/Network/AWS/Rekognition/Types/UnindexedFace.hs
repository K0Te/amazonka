-- | Creates a value of 'UnindexedFace' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ufReasons' - An array of reasons that specify why a face wasn't indexed.      * EXTREME_POSE - The face is at a pose that can't be detected. For example, the head is turned too far away from the camera.     * EXCEEDS_MAX_FACES - The number of faces detected is already higher than that specified by the @MaxFaces@ input parameter for @IndexFaces@ .     * LOW_BRIGHTNESS - The image is too dark.     * LOW_SHARPNESS - The image is too blurry.     * LOW_CONFIDENCE - The face was detected with a low confidence.     * SMALL_BOUNDING_BOX - The bounding box around the face is too small.
--
-- * 'ufFaceDetail' - The structure that contains attributes of a face that @IndexFaces@ detected, but didn't index.
