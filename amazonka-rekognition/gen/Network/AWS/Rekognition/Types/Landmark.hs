-- | Creates a value of 'Landmark' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lType' - Type of landmark.
--
-- * 'lX' - The x-coordinate of the landmark expressed as a ratio of the width of the image. The x-coordinate is measured from the left-side of the image. For example, if the image is 700 pixels wide and the x-coordinate of the landmark is at 350 pixels, this value is 0.5. 
--
-- * 'lY' - The y-coordinate of the landmark expressed as a ratio of the height of the image. The y-coordinate is measured from the top of the image. For example, if the image height is 200 pixels and the y-coordinate of the landmark is at 50 pixels, this value is 0.25.
