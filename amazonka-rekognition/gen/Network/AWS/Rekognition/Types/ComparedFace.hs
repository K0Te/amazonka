-- | Creates a value of 'ComparedFace' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cfBoundingBox' - Bounding box of the face.
--
-- * 'cfPose' - Indicates the pose of the face as determined by its pitch, roll, and yaw.
--
-- * 'cfConfidence' - Level of confidence that what the bounding box contains is a face.
--
-- * 'cfQuality' - Identifies face image brightness and sharpness. 
--
-- * 'cfLandmarks' - An array of facial landmarks.
