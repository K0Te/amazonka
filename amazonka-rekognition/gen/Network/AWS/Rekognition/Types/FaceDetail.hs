-- | Structure containing attributes of the face that the algorithm detected.
--
--
-- A @FaceDetail@ object contains either the default facial attributes or all facial attributes. The default attributes are @BoundingBox@ , @Confidence@ , @Landmarks@ , @Pose@ , and @Quality@ .
--
-- 'GetFaceDetection' is the only Amazon Rekognition Video stored video operation that can return a @FaceDetail@ object with all attributes. To specify which attributes to return, use the @FaceAttributes@ input parameter for 'StartFaceDetection' . The following Amazon Rekognition Video operations return only the default attributes. The corresponding Start operations don't have a @FaceAttributes@ input parameter.
--
--     * GetCelebrityRecognition
--
--     * GetPersonTracking
--
--     * GetFaceSearch
--
--
--
-- The Amazon Rekognition Image 'DetectFaces' and 'IndexFaces' operations can return all facial attributes. To specify which attributes to return, use the @Attributes@ input parameter for @DetectFaces@ . For @IndexFaces@ , use the @DetectAttributes@ input parameter.

-- | Creates a value of 'FaceDetail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fdAgeRange' - The estimated age range, in years, for the face. Low represents the lowest estimated age and High represents the highest estimated age.
--
-- * 'fdSunglasses' - Indicates whether or not the face is wearing sunglasses, and the confidence level in the determination.
--
-- * 'fdMouthOpen' - Indicates whether or not the mouth on the face is open, and the confidence level in the determination.
--
-- * 'fdBoundingBox' - Bounding box of the face. Default attribute.
--
-- * 'fdEmotions' - The emotions that appear to be expressed on the face, and the confidence level in the determination. The API is only making a determination of the physical appearance of a person's face. It is not a determination of the person’s internal emotional state and should not be used in such a way. For example, a person pretending to have a sad face might not be sad emotionally.
--
-- * 'fdEyesOpen' - Indicates whether or not the eyes on the face are open, and the confidence level in the determination.
--
-- * 'fdPose' - Indicates the pose of the face as determined by its pitch, roll, and yaw. Default attribute.
--
-- * 'fdConfidence' - Confidence level that the bounding box contains a face (and not a different object such as a tree). Default attribute.
--
-- * 'fdGender' - The predicted gender of a detected face. 
--
-- * 'fdQuality' - Identifies image brightness and sharpness. Default attribute.
--
-- * 'fdEyeglasses' - Indicates whether or not the face is wearing eye glasses, and the confidence level in the determination.
--
-- * 'fdBeard' - Indicates whether or not the face has a beard, and the confidence level in the determination.
--
-- * 'fdMustache' - Indicates whether or not the face has a mustache, and the confidence level in the determination.
--
-- * 'fdSmile' - Indicates whether or not the face is smiling, and the confidence level in the determination.
--
-- * 'fdLandmarks' - Indicates the location of landmarks on the face. Default attribute.
