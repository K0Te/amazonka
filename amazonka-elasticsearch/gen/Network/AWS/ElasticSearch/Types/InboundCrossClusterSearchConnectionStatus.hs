-- | Creates a value of 'InboundCrossClusterSearchConnectionStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iccscsMessage' - Specifies verbose information for the inbound connection status.
--
-- * 'iccscsStatusCode' - The state code for inbound connection. This can be one of the following:     * PENDING_ACCEPTANCE: Inbound connection is not yet accepted by destination domain owner.    * APPROVED: Inbound connection is pending acceptance by destination domain owner.    * REJECTING: Inbound connection rejection is in process.    * REJECTED: Inbound connection is rejected.    * DELETING: Inbound connection deletion is in progress.    * DELETED: Inbound connection is deleted and cannot be used further.
