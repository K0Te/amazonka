-- | Creates a value of 'OutboundCrossClusterSearchConnectionStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'occscsMessage' - Specifies verbose information for the outbound connection status.
--
-- * 'occscsStatusCode' - The state code for outbound connection. This can be one of the following:     * VALIDATING: The outbound connection request is being validated.    * VALIDATION_FAILED: Validation failed for the connection request.    * PENDING_ACCEPTANCE: Outbound connection request is validated and is not yet accepted by destination domain owner.    * PROVISIONING: Outbound connection request is in process.    * ACTIVE: Outbound connection is active and ready to use.    * REJECTED: Outbound connection request is rejected by destination domain owner.    * DELETING: Outbound connection deletion is in progress.    * DELETED: Outbound connection is deleted and cannot be used further.
