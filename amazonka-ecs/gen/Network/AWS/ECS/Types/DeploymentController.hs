-- | Creates a value of 'DeploymentController' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dcType' - The deployment controller type to use. There are three deployment controller types available:     * ECS    * The rolling update (@ECS@ ) deployment type involves replacing the current running version of the container with the latest version. The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by adjusting the minimum and maximum number of healthy tasks allowed during a service deployment, as specified in the 'DeploymentConfiguration' .     * CODE_DEPLOY    * The blue/green (@CODE_DEPLOY@ ) deployment type uses the blue/green deployment model powered by AWS CodeDeploy, which allows you to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it.     * EXTERNAL    * The external (@EXTERNAL@ ) deployment type enables you to use any third-party deployment controller for full control over the deployment process for an Amazon ECS service.
