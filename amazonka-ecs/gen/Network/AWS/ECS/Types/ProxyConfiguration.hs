-- | The configuration details for the App Mesh proxy.
--
--
-- For tasks using the EC2 launch type, the container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent and at least version 1.26.0-1 of the @ecs-init@ package to enable a proxy configuration. If your container instances are launched from the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI version @20190301@ or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and @ecs-init@ . For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI>

-- | Creates a value of 'ProxyConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pType' - The proxy type. The only supported value is @APPMESH@ .
--
-- * 'pProperties' - The set of network configuration parameters to provide the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, specified as key-value pairs.     * @IgnoredUID@ - (Required) The user ID (UID) of the proxy container as defined by the @user@ parameter in a container definition. This is used to ensure the proxy ignores its own traffic. If @IgnoredGID@ is specified, this field can be empty.     * @IgnoredGID@ - (Required) The group ID (GID) of the proxy container as defined by the @user@ parameter in a container definition. This is used to ensure the proxy ignores its own traffic. If @IgnoredUID@ is specified, this field can be empty.     * @AppPorts@ - (Required) The list of ports that the application uses. Network traffic to these ports is forwarded to the @ProxyIngressPort@ and @ProxyEgressPort@ .     * @ProxyIngressPort@ - (Required) Specifies the port that incoming traffic to the @AppPorts@ is directed to.     * @ProxyEgressPort@ - (Required) Specifies the port that outgoing traffic from the @AppPorts@ is directed to.     * @EgressIgnoredPorts@ - (Required) The egress traffic going to the specified ports is ignored and not redirected to the @ProxyEgressPort@ . It can be an empty list.     * @EgressIgnoredIPs@ - (Required) The egress traffic going to the specified IP addresses is ignored and not redirected to the @ProxyEgressPort@ . It can be an empty list.
--
-- * 'pContainerName' - The name of the container that will serve as the App Mesh proxy.
