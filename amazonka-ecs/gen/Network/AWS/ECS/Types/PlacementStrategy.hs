-- | Creates a value of 'PlacementStrategy' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'psField' - The field to apply the placement strategy against. For the @spread@ placement strategy, valid values are @instanceId@ (or @host@ , which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as @attribute:ecs.availability-zone@ . For the @binpack@ placement strategy, valid values are @cpu@ and @memory@ . For the @random@ placement strategy, this field is not used.
--
-- * 'psType' - The type of placement strategy. The @random@ placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The @spread@ placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the @field@ parameter. The @binpack@ strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that is specified with the @field@ parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory (but still enough to run the task).
