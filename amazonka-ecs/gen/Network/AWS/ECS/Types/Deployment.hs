-- | Creates a value of 'Deployment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dRolloutState' - The rollout state of the deployment. When a service deployment is started, it begins in an @IN_PROGRESS@ state. When the service reaches a steady state, the deployment will transition to a @COMPLETED@ state. If the service fails to reach a steady state and circuit breaker is enabled, the deployment will transition to a @FAILED@ state. A deployment in @FAILED@ state will launch no new tasks. For more information, see 'DeploymentCircuitBreaker' .
--
-- * 'dRunningCount' - The number of tasks in the deployment that are in the @RUNNING@ status.
--
-- * 'dStatus' - The status of the deployment. The following describes each state:     * PRIMARY    * The most recent deployment of a service.     * ACTIVE    * A service deployment that still has running tasks, but are in the process of being replaced with a new @PRIMARY@ deployment.     * INACTIVE    * A deployment that has been completely replaced.
--
-- * 'dCreatedAt' - The Unix timestamp for when the service deployment was created.
--
-- * 'dPlatformVersion' - The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one is not specified, the @LATEST@ platform version is used by default. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html AWS Fargate Platform Versions> in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'dDesiredCount' - The most recent desired count of tasks that was specified for the service to deploy or maintain.
--
-- * 'dPendingCount' - The number of tasks in the deployment that are in the @PENDING@ status.
--
-- * 'dId' - The ID of the deployment.
--
-- * 'dFailedTasks' - The number of consecutively failed tasks in the deployment. A task is considered a failure if the service scheduler can't launch the task, the task doesn't transition to a @RUNNING@ state, or if it fails any of its defined health checks and is stopped.
--
-- * 'dLaunchType' - The launch type the tasks in the service are using. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html Amazon ECS Launch Types> in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'dUpdatedAt' - The Unix timestamp for when the service deployment was last updated.
--
-- * 'dTaskDefinition' - The most recent task definition that was specified for the tasks in the service to use.
--
-- * 'dRolloutStateReason' - A description of the rollout state of a deployment.
--
-- * 'dNetworkConfiguration' - The VPC subnet and security group configuration for tasks that receive their own elastic network interface by using the @awsvpc@ networking mode.
--
-- * 'dCapacityProviderStrategy' - The capacity provider strategy that the deployment is using.
