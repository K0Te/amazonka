-- | Creates a value of 'Container' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cGpuIds' - The IDs of each GPU assigned to the container.
--
-- * 'cNetworkBindings' - The network bindings associated with the container.
--
-- * 'cImage' - The image used for the container.
--
-- * 'cContainerARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container.
--
-- * 'cNetworkInterfaces' - The network interfaces associated with the container.
--
-- * 'cTaskARN' - The ARN of the task.
--
-- * 'cLastStatus' - The last known status of the container.
--
-- * 'cMemory' - The hard limit (in MiB) of memory set for the container.
--
-- * 'cReason' - A short (255 max characters) human-readable string to provide additional details about a running or stopped container.
--
-- * 'cName' - The name of the container.
--
-- * 'cImageDigest' - The container image manifest digest.
--
-- * 'cExitCode' - The exit code returned from the container.
--
-- * 'cHealthStatus' - The health status of the container. If health checks are not configured for this container in its task definition, then it reports the health status as @UNKNOWN@ .
--
-- * 'cCpu' - The number of CPU units set for the container. The value will be @0@ if no value was specified in the container definition when the task definition was registered.
--
-- * 'cRuntimeId' - The ID of the Docker container.
--
-- * 'cMemoryReservation' - The soft limit (in MiB) of memory set for the container.
