-- | Creates a value of 'CapacityProviderStrategyItem' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cpsiBase' - The /base/ value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a /base/ defined.
--
-- * 'cpsiWeight' - The /weight/ value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider. For example, if you have a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of @1@ , then when the @base@ is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of @1@ for /capacityProviderA/ and a weight of @4@ for /capacityProviderB/ , then for every one task that is run using /capacityProviderA/ , four tasks would use /capacityProviderB/ .
--
-- * 'cpsiCapacityProvider' - The short name of the capacity provider.
