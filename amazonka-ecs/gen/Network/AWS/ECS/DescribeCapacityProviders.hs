-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeCapacityProviders' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dcpInclude' - Specifies whether or not you want to see the resource tags for the capacity provider. If @TAGS@ is specified, the tags are included in the response. If this field is omitted, tags are not included in the response.
--
-- * 'dcpNextToken' - The @nextToken@ value returned from a previous paginated @DescribeCapacityProviders@ request where @maxResults@ was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the @nextToken@ value.
--
-- * 'dcpCapacityProviders' - The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of one or more capacity providers. Up to @100@ capacity providers can be described in an action.
--
-- * 'dcpMaxResults' - The maximum number of account setting results returned by @DescribeCapacityProviders@ in paginated output. When this parameter is used, @DescribeCapacityProviders@ only returns @maxResults@ results in a single page along with a @nextToken@ response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another @DescribeCapacityProviders@ request with the returned @nextToken@ value. This value can be between 1 and 10. If this parameter is not used, then @DescribeCapacityProviders@ returns up to 10 results and a @nextToken@ value if applicable.
