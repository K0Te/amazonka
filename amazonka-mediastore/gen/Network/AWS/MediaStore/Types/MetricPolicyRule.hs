module Network.AWS.MediaStore.Types.MetricPolicyRule where

import Network.AWS.Lens

-- | A setting that enables metrics at the object level. Each rule contains an object group and an object group name. If the policy includes the MetricPolicyRules parameter, you must include at least one rule. Each metric policy can include up to five rules by default. You can also <https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1#!/services/mediastore/quotas request a quota increase> to allow up to 300 rules per policy.
