-- | Creates a value of 'CORSRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'crAllowedMethods' - Identifies an HTTP method that the origin that is specified in the rule is allowed to execute. Each CORS rule must contain at least one @AllowedMethods@ and one @AllowedOrigins@ element.
--
-- * 'crMaxAgeSeconds' - The time in seconds that your browser caches the preflight response for the specified resource. A CORS rule can have only one @MaxAgeSeconds@ element.
--
-- * 'crExposeHeaders' - One or more headers in the response that you want users to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript @XMLHttpRequest@ object). This element is optional for each rule.
--
-- * 'crAllowedOrigins' - One or more response headers that you want users to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript @XMLHttpRequest@ object). Each CORS rule must have at least one @AllowedOrigins@ element. The string value can include only one wildcard character (*), for example, http://*.example.com. Additionally, you can specify only one wildcard character to allow cross-origin access for all origins.
--
-- * 'crAllowedHeaders' - Specifies which headers are allowed in a preflight @OPTIONS@ request through the @Access-Control-Request-Headers@ header. Each header name that is specified in @Access-Control-Request-Headers@ must have a corresponding entry in the rule. Only the headers that were requested are sent back.  This element can contain only one wildcard character (*).
