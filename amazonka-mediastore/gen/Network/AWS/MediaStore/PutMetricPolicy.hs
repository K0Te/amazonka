-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pmpContainerName' - The name of the container that you want to add the metric policy to.
--
-- * 'pmpMetricPolicy' - The metric policy that you want to associate with the container. In the policy, you must indicate whether you want MediaStore to send container-level metrics. You can also include up to five rules to define groups of objects that you want MediaStore to send object-level metrics for. If you include rules in the policy, construct each rule with both of the following:     * An object group that defines which objects to include in the group. The definition can be a path or a file name, but it can't have more than 900 characters. Valid characters are: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ (underscore), = (equal), : (colon), . (period), - (hyphen), ~ (tilde), / (forward slash), and * (asterisk). Wildcards (*) are acceptable.     * An object group name that allows you to refer to the object group. The name can't have more than 30 characters. Valid characters are: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ (underscore).
