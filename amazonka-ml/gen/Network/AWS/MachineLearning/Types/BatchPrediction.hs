-- | Creates a value of 'BatchPrediction' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bpStatus' - The status of the @BatchPrediction@ . This element can have one of the following values:     * @PENDING@ - Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) submitted a request to generate predictions for a batch of observations.    * @INPROGRESS@ - The process is underway.    * @FAILED@ - The request to perform a batch prediction did not run to completion. It is not usable.    * @COMPLETED@ - The batch prediction process completed successfully.    * @DELETED@ - The @BatchPrediction@ is marked as deleted. It is not usable.
--
-- * 'bpLastUpdatedAt' - The time of the most recent edit to the @BatchPrediction@ . The time is expressed in epoch time.
--
-- * 'bpCreatedAt' - The time that the @BatchPrediction@ was created. The time is expressed in epoch time.
--
-- * 'bpComputeTime' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bpInputDataLocationS3' - The location of the data file or directory in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
--
-- * 'bpMLModelId' - The ID of the @MLModel@ that generated predictions for the @BatchPrediction@ request.
--
-- * 'bpBatchPredictionDataSourceId' - The ID of the @DataSource@ that points to the group of observations to predict.
--
-- * 'bpTotalRecordCount' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bpStartedAt' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bpBatchPredictionId' - The ID assigned to the @BatchPrediction@ at creation. This value should be identical to the value of the @BatchPredictionID@ in the request. 
--
-- * 'bpFinishedAt' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bpInvalidRecordCount' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'bpCreatedByIAMUser' - The AWS user account that invoked the @BatchPrediction@ . The account type can be either an AWS root account or an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user account.
--
-- * 'bpName' - A user-supplied name or description of the @BatchPrediction@ .
--
-- * 'bpMessage' - A description of the most recent details about processing the batch prediction request.
--
-- * 'bpOutputURI' - The location of an Amazon S3 bucket or directory to receive the operation results. The following substrings are not allowed in the @s3 key@ portion of the @outputURI@ field: ':', '//', '/./', '/../'.
