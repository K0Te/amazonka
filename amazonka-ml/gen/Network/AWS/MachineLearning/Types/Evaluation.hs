-- | Creates a value of 'Evaluation' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eStatus' - The status of the evaluation. This element can have one of the following values:     * @PENDING@ - Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) submitted a request to evaluate an @MLModel@ .    * @INPROGRESS@ - The evaluation is underway.    * @FAILED@ - The request to evaluate an @MLModel@ did not run to completion. It is not usable.    * @COMPLETED@ - The evaluation process completed successfully.    * @DELETED@ - The @Evaluation@ is marked as deleted. It is not usable.
--
-- * 'ePerformanceMetrics' - Measurements of how well the @MLModel@ performed, using observations referenced by the @DataSource@ . One of the following metrics is returned, based on the type of the @MLModel@ :      * BinaryAUC: A binary @MLModel@ uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC) technique to measure performance.      * RegressionRMSE: A regression @MLModel@ uses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) technique to measure performance. RMSE measures the difference between predicted and actual values for a single variable.     * MulticlassAvgFScore: A multiclass @MLModel@ uses the F1 score technique to measure performance.  For more information about performance metrics, please see the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg Amazon Machine Learning Developer Guide> . 
--
-- * 'eLastUpdatedAt' - The time of the most recent edit to the @Evaluation@ . The time is expressed in epoch time.
--
-- * 'eCreatedAt' - The time that the @Evaluation@ was created. The time is expressed in epoch time.
--
-- * 'eComputeTime' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'eInputDataLocationS3' - The location and name of the data in Amazon Simple Storage Server (Amazon S3) that is used in the evaluation.
--
-- * 'eMLModelId' - The ID of the @MLModel@ that is the focus of the evaluation.
--
-- * 'eStartedAt' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'eFinishedAt' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'eCreatedByIAMUser' - The AWS user account that invoked the evaluation. The account type can be either an AWS root account or an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user account.
--
-- * 'eName' - A user-supplied name or description of the @Evaluation@ . 
--
-- * 'eEvaluationId' - The ID that is assigned to the @Evaluation@ at creation.
--
-- * 'eMessage' - A description of the most recent details about evaluating the @MLModel@ .
--
-- * 'eEvaluationDataSourceId' - The ID of the @DataSource@ that is used to evaluate the @MLModel@ .
