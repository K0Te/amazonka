-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fFacetStyle' - There are two different styles that you can define on any given facet, @Static@ and @Dynamic@ . For static facets, all attributes must be defined in the schema. For dynamic facets, attributes can be defined during data plane operations.
--
-- * 'fObjectType' - The object type that is associated with the facet. See 'CreateFacetRequest$ObjectType' for more details.
--
-- * 'fName' - The name of the 'Facet' .
