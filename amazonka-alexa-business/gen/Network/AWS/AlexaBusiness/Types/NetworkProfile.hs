-- | Creates a value of 'NetworkProfile' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'npNetworkProfileName' - The name of the network profile associated with a device.
--
-- * 'npSsid' - The SSID of the Wi-Fi network.
--
-- * 'npNetworkProfileARN' - The ARN of the network profile associated with a device.
--
-- * 'npSecurityType' - The security type of the Wi-Fi network. This can be WPA2_ENTERPRISE, WPA2_PSK, WPA_PSK, WEP, or OPEN.
--
-- * 'npCurrentPassword' - The current password of the Wi-Fi network.
--
-- * 'npNextPassword' - The next, or subsequent, password of the Wi-Fi network. This password is asynchronously transmitted to the device and is used when the password of the network changes to NextPassword. 
--
-- * 'npEapMethod' - The authentication standard that is used in the EAP framework. Currently, EAP_TLS is supported. 
--
-- * 'npDescription' - Detailed information about a device's network profile.
--
-- * 'npTrustAnchors' - The root certificates of your authentication server, which is installed on your devices and used to trust your authentication server during EAP negotiation.
--
-- * 'npCertificateAuthorityARN' - The ARN of the Private Certificate Authority (PCA) created in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). This is used to issue certificates to the devices.
