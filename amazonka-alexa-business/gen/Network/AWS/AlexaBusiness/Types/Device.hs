-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dDeviceStatus' - The status of a device. If the status is not READY, check the DeviceStatusInfo value for details.
--
-- * 'dDeviceStatusInfo' - Detailed information about a device's status.
--
-- * 'dDeviceARN' - The ARN of a device.
--
-- * 'dMACAddress' - The MAC address of a device.
--
-- * 'dDeviceName' - The name of a device.
--
-- * 'dRoomARN' - The room ARN of a device.
--
-- * 'dSoftwareVersion' - The software version of a device.
--
-- * 'dDeviceType' - The type of a device.
--
-- * 'dNetworkProfileInfo' - Detailed information about a device's network profile.
--
-- * 'dDeviceSerialNumber' - The serial number of a device.
