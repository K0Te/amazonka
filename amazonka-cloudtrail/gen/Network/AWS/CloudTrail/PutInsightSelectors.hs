-- Lets you enable Insights event logging by specifying the Insights selectors that you want to enable on an existing trail. You also use @PutInsightSelectors@ to turn off Insights event logging, by passing an empty list of insight types. In this release, only @ApiCallRateInsight@ is supported as an Insights selector.
