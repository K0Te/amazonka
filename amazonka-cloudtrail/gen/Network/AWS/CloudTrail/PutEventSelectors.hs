-- Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events.
--
--
-- When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event. 
--
-- Example
--
--     * You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.
--
--     * The EC2 @GetConsoleOutput@ and @RunInstances@ API operations occur in your account.
--
--     * CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
--
--     * The @RunInstances@ is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
--
--     * The @GetConsoleOutput@ is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event. 
--
--
--
-- The @PutEventSelectors@ operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an @InvalidHomeRegionException@ exception is thrown.
--
-- You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html Logging data and management events for trails > and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html Quotas in AWS CloudTrail> in the /AWS CloudTrail User Guide/ .
--
-- You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either @AdvancedEventSelectors@ or @EventSelectors@ , but not both. If you apply @AdvancedEventSelectors@ to a trail, any existing @EventSelectors@ are overwritten. For more information about advanced event selectors, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html Logging data events for trails> in the /AWS CloudTrail User Guide/ .

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pesEventSelectors' - Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail. You can use either @EventSelectors@ or @AdvancedEventSelectors@ in a @PutEventSelectors@ request, but not both. If you apply @EventSelectors@ to a trail, any existing @AdvancedEventSelectors@ are overwritten.

You can use either @AdvancedEventSelectors@ or @EventSelectors@ , but not both. If you apply @AdvancedEventSelectors@ to a trail, any existing @EventSelectors@ are overwritten.

--
-- * 'pesTrailName' - Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail name, the string must meet the following requirements:     * Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or dashes (-)     * Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number     * Be between 3 and 128 characters     * Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like @my-_namespace@ and @my--namespace@ are invalid.     * Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4) If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the format: @arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail@
