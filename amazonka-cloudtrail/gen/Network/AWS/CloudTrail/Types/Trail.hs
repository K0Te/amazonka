-- | Creates a value of 'Trail' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tLogFileValidationEnabled' - Specifies whether log file validation is enabled.
--
-- * 'tTrailARN' - Specifies the ARN of the trail. The format of a trail ARN is: @arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail@ 
--
-- * 'tS3KeyPrefix' - Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-find-log-files.html Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files> .The maximum length is 200 characters.
--
-- * 'tHasInsightSelectors' - Specifies whether a trail has insight types specified in an @InsightSelector@ list.
--
-- * 'tSNSTopicARN' - Specifies the ARN of the Amazon SNS topic that CloudTrail uses to send notifications when log files are delivered. The format of a topic ARN is: @arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyTopic@ 
--
-- * 'tSNSTopicName' - This field is no longer in use. Use SnsTopicARN.
--
-- * 'tCloudWatchLogsLogGroupARN' - Specifies an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered.
--
-- * 'tKMSKeyId' - Specifies the KMS key ID that encrypts the logs delivered by CloudTrail. The value is a fully specified ARN to a KMS key in the format: @arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012@ 
--
-- * 'tHomeRegion' - The region in which the trail was created.
--
-- * 'tName' - Name of the trail set by calling 'CreateTrail' . The maximum length is 128 characters.
--
-- * 'tIncludeGlobalServiceEvents' - Set to __True__ to include AWS API calls from AWS global services such as IAM. Otherwise, __False__ .
--
-- * 'tHasCustomEventSelectors' - Specifies if the trail has custom event selectors.
--
-- * 'tIsOrganizationTrail' - Specifies whether the trail is an organization trail.
--
-- * 'tCloudWatchLogsRoleARN' - Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user's log group.
--
-- * 'tS3BucketName' - Name of the Amazon S3 bucket into which CloudTrail delivers your trail files. See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_naming_policy.html Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements> .
--
-- * 'tIsMultiRegionTrail' - Specifies whether the trail exists only in one region or exists in all regions.
