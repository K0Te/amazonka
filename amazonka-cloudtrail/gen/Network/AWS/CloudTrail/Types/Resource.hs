-- | Creates a value of 'Resource' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rResourceType' - The type of a resource referenced by the event returned. When the resource type cannot be determined, null is returned. Some examples of resource types are: __Instance__ for EC2, __Trail__ for CloudTrail, __DBInstance__ for RDS, and __AccessKey__ for IAM. To learn more about how to look up and filter events by the resource types supported for a service, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events-console.html#filtering-cloudtrail-events Filtering CloudTrail Events> .
--
-- * 'rResourceName' - The name of the resource referenced by the event returned. These are user-created names whose values will depend on the environment. For example, the resource name might be "auto-scaling-test-group" for an Auto Scaling Group or "i-1234567" for an EC2 Instance.
