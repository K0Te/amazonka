-- Deploys multiple groups in one operation. This action starts the bulk deployment of a specified set of group versions. Each group version deployment will be triggered with an adaptive rate that has a fixed upper limit. We recommend that you include an ''X-Amzn-Client-Token'' token in every ''StartBulkDeployment'' request. These requests are idempotent with respect to the token and the request parameters.

-- | Creates a value of 'StartBulkDeployment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sbdAmznClientToken' - A client token used to correlate requests and responses.
--
-- * 'sbdTags' - Tag(s) to add to the new resource.
--
-- * 'sbdExecutionRoleARN' - The ARN of the execution role to associate with the bulk deployment operation. This IAM role must allow the ''greengrass:CreateDeployment'' action for all group versions that are listed in the input file. This IAM role must have access to the S3 bucket containing the input file.
--
-- * 'sbdInputFileURI' - The URI of the input file contained in the S3 bucket. The execution role must have ''getObject'' permissions on this bucket to access the input file. The input file is a JSON-serialized, line delimited file with UTF-8 encoding that provides a list of group and version IDs and the deployment type. This file must be less than 100 MB. Currently, AWS IoT Greengrass supports only ''NewDeployment'' deployment types.
