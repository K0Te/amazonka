-- | Creates a value of 'ApplicationSettingsResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'asEnabled' - Specifies whether persistent application settings are enabled for users during their streaming sessions.
--
-- * 'asSettingsGroup' - The path prefix for the S3 bucket where users’ persistent application settings are stored.
--
-- * 'asS3BucketName' - The S3 bucket where users’ persistent application settings are stored. When persistent application settings are enabled for the first time for an account in an AWS Region, an S3 bucket is created. The bucket is unique to the AWS account and the Region.
