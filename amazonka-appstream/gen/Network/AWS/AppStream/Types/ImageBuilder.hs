-- | Creates a value of 'ImageBuilder' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ibDomainJoinInfo' - The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use to join the image builder to a Microsoft Active Directory domain. 
--
-- * 'ibIAMRoleARN' - The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the image builder. To assume a role, the image builder calls the AWS Security Token Service (STS) @AssumeRole@ API operation and passes the ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a new session with temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the __appstream_machine_role__ credential profile on the instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/using-iam-roles-to-grant-permissions-to-applications-scripts-streaming-instances.html Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming Instances> in the /Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide/ .
--
-- * 'ibState' - The state of the image builder.
--
-- * 'ibPlatform' - The operating system platform of the image builder.
--
-- * 'ibNetworkAccessConfiguration' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'ibStateChangeReason' - The reason why the last state change occurred.
--
-- * 'ibARN' - The ARN for the image builder.
--
-- * 'ibCreatedTime' - The time stamp when the image builder was created.
--
-- * 'ibImageBuilderErrors' - The image builder errors.
--
-- * 'ibInstanceType' - The instance type for the image builder. The following instance types are available:     * stream.standard.medium     * stream.standard.large     * stream.compute.large     * stream.compute.xlarge     * stream.compute.2xlarge     * stream.compute.4xlarge     * stream.compute.8xlarge     * stream.memory.large     * stream.memory.xlarge     * stream.memory.2xlarge     * stream.memory.4xlarge     * stream.memory.8xlarge     * stream.memory.z1d.large     * stream.memory.z1d.xlarge     * stream.memory.z1d.2xlarge     * stream.memory.z1d.3xlarge     * stream.memory.z1d.6xlarge     * stream.memory.z1d.12xlarge     * stream.graphics-design.large     * stream.graphics-design.xlarge     * stream.graphics-design.2xlarge     * stream.graphics-design.4xlarge     * stream.graphics-desktop.2xlarge     * stream.graphics.g4dn.xlarge     * stream.graphics.g4dn.2xlarge     * stream.graphics.g4dn.4xlarge     * stream.graphics.g4dn.8xlarge     * stream.graphics.g4dn.12xlarge     * stream.graphics.g4dn.16xlarge     * stream.graphics-pro.4xlarge     * stream.graphics-pro.8xlarge     * stream.graphics-pro.16xlarge
