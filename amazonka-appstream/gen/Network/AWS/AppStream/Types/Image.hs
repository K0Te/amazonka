-- | Creates a value of 'Image' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'iState' - The image starts in the @PENDING@ state. If image creation succeeds, the state is @AVAILABLE@ . If image creation fails, the state is @FAILED@ .
--
-- * 'iImagePermissions' - The permissions to provide to the destination AWS account for the specified image.
--
-- * 'iPlatform' - The operating system platform of the image.
--
-- * 'iPublicBaseImageReleasedDate' - The release date of the public base image. For private images, this date is the release date of the base image from which the image was created.
--
-- * 'iStateChangeReason' - The reason why the last state change occurred.
--
-- * 'iARN' - The ARN of the image.
--
-- * 'iCreatedTime' - The time the image was created.
--
-- * 'iImageBuilderSupported' - Indicates whether an image builder can be launched from this image.
--
-- * 'iVisibility' - Indicates whether the image is public or private.
--
-- * 'iImageBuilderName' - The name of the image builder that was used to create the private image. If the image is shared, this value is null.
--
-- * 'iBaseImageARN' - The ARN of the image from which this image was created.
--
-- * 'iDisplayName' - The image name to display.
--
-- * 'iDescription' - The description to display.

-- * 'iAppstreamAgentVersion' - The version of the AppStream 2.0 agent to use for instances that are launched from this image. 
--
-- * 'iApplications' - The applications associated with the image.
