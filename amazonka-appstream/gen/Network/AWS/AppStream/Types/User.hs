-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'uStatus' - The status of the user in the user pool. The status can be one of the following:     * UNCONFIRMED – The user is created but not confirmed.     * CONFIRMED – The user is confirmed.     * ARCHIVED – The user is no longer active.     * COMPROMISED – The user is disabled because of a potential security threat.     * UNKNOWN – The user status is not known.
--
-- * 'uEnabled' - Specifies whether the user in the user pool is enabled.
--
-- * 'uLastName' - The last name, or surname, of the user.
--
-- * 'uARN' - The ARN of the user.
--
-- * 'uCreatedTime' - The date and time the user was created in the user pool.
--
-- * 'uUserName' - The email address of the user.
--
-- * 'uFirstName' - The first name, or given name, of the user.
--
-- * 'uAuthenticationType' - The authentication type for the user.
