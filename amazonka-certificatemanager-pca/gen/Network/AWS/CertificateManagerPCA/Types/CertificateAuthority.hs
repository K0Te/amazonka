-- | Contains information about your private certificate authority (CA). Your private CA can issue and revoke X.509 digital certificates. Digital certificates verify that the entity named in the certificate __Subject__ field owns or controls the public key contained in the __Subject Public Key Info__ field. Call the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html CreateCertificateAuthority> action to create your private CA. You must then call the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate> action to retrieve a private CA certificate signing request (CSR). Sign the CSR with your ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or subordinate CA certificate. Call the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate> action to import the signed certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
