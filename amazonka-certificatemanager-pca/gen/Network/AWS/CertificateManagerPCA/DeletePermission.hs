-- Revokes permissions on a private CA granted to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com). 
--
--
-- These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same AWS account as the CA. If you revoke these permissions, ACM will no longer renew the affected certificates automatically.
--
-- Permissions can be granted with the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePermission.html CreatePermission> action and listed with the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ListPermissions.html ListPermissions> action. 
--
-- __About Permissions__ 
--
--     * If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use @CreatePermission@ to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.
--
--     * For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.
--
--     * If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see <acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA> .
