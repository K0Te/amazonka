-- | Creates a value of 'Pipeline' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pipStatus' - The current status of the pipeline:     * @Active@ : The pipeline is processing jobs.     * @Paused@ : The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.
--
-- * 'pipARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pipeline.
--
-- * 'pipInputBucket' - The Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets media files for transcoding and the graphics files, if any, that you want to use for watermarks.
--
-- * 'pipContentConfig' - Information about the Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save transcoded files and playlists. Either you specify both @ContentConfig@ and @ThumbnailConfig@ , or you specify @OutputBucket@ .     * __Bucket__ : The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save transcoded files and playlists.     * __Permissions__ : A list of the users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups you want to have access to transcoded files and playlists, and the type of access that you want them to have.      * GranteeType: The type of value that appears in the @Grantee@ object:      * @Canonical@ : Either the canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution.     * @Email@ : The registered email address of an AWS account.     * @Group@ : One of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: @AllUsers@ , @AuthenticatedUsers@ , or @LogDelivery@ .     * @Grantee@ : The AWS user or group that you want to have access to transcoded files and playlists.     * @Access@ : The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that is listed in @Grantee@ . Valid values include:     * @READ@ : The grantee can read the objects and metadata for objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * @READ_ACP@ : The grantee can read the object ACL for objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * @WRITE_ACP@ : The grantee can write the ACL for the objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * @FULL_CONTROL@ : The grantee has @READ@ , @READ_ACP@ , and @WRITE_ACP@ permissions for the objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * __StorageClass__ : The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy, that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket. 
--
-- * 'pipOutputBucket' - The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save transcoded files, thumbnails, and playlists. Either you specify this value, or you specify both @ContentConfig@ and @ThumbnailConfig@ .
--
-- * 'pipRole' - The IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the role that Elastic Transcoder uses to transcode jobs for this pipeline.
--
-- * 'pipName' - The name of the pipeline. We recommend that the name be unique within the AWS account, but uniqueness is not enforced. Constraints: Maximum 40 characters
--
-- * 'pipAWSKMSKeyARN' - The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you want to use with this pipeline. If you use either @s3@ or @s3-aws-kms@ as your @Encryption:Mode@ , you don't need to provide a key with your job because a default key, known as an AWS-KMS key, is created for you automatically. You need to provide an AWS-KMS key only if you want to use a non-default AWS-KMS key, or if you are using an @Encryption:Mode@ of @aes-cbc-pkcs7@ , @aes-ctr@ , or @aes-gcm@ .
--
-- * 'pipId' - The identifier for the pipeline. You use this value to identify the pipeline in which you want to perform a variety of operations, such as creating a job or a preset.
--
-- * 'pipNotifications' - The Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you want to notify to report job status. /Important:/ To receive notifications, you must also subscribe to the new topic in the Amazon SNS console.     * __Progressing__ (optional): The Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder has started to process the job.     * __Complete__ (optional): The Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder has finished processing the job.     * __Warning__ (optional): The Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder encounters a warning condition.     * __Error__ (optional): The Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder encounters an error condition.
--
-- * 'pipThumbnailConfig' - Information about the Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save thumbnail files. Either you specify both @ContentConfig@ and @ThumbnailConfig@ , or you specify @OutputBucket@ .     * @Bucket@ : The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save thumbnail files.      * @Permissions@ : A list of the users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups you want to have access to thumbnail files, and the type of access that you want them to have.      * GranteeType: The type of value that appears in the Grantee object:     * @Canonical@ : Either the canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. /Important:/ A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account number.     * @Email@ : The registered email address of an AWS account.     * @Group@ : One of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: @AllUsers@ , @AuthenticatedUsers@ , or @LogDelivery@ .     * @Grantee@ : The AWS user or group that you want to have access to thumbnail files.     * Access: The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that is listed in Grantee. Valid values include:      * @READ@ : The grantee can read the thumbnails and metadata for thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * @READ_ACP@ : The grantee can read the object ACL for thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * @WRITE_ACP@ : The grantee can write the ACL for the thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * @FULL_CONTROL@ : The grantee has READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions for the thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     * @StorageClass@ : The Amazon S3 storage class, @Standard@ or @ReducedRedundancy@ , that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the thumbnails that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.
