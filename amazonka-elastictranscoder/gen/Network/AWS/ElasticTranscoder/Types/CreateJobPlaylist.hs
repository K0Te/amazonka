-- | Creates a value of 'CreateJobPlaylist' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cjpPlayReadyDrm' - The DRM settings, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder to apply to the output files associated with this playlist.
--
-- * 'cjpFormat' - The format of the output playlist. Valid formats include @HLSv3@ , @HLSv4@ , and @Smooth@ .
--
-- * 'cjpOutputKeys' - For each output in this job that you want to include in a master playlist, the value of the @Outputs:Key@ object.      * If your output is not @HLS@ or does not have a segment duration set, the name of the output file is a concatenation of @OutputKeyPrefix@ and @Outputs:Key@ : OutputKeyPrefix@Outputs:Key@      * If your output is @HLSv3@ and has a segment duration set, or is not included in a playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an output playlist file with a file extension of @.m3u8@ , and a series of @.ts@ files that include a five-digit sequential counter beginning with 00000: OutputKeyPrefix@Outputs:Key@ .m3u8 OutputKeyPrefix@Outputs:Key@ 00000.ts     * If your output is @HLSv4@ , has a segment duration set, and is included in an @HLSv4@ playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an output playlist file with a file extension of @_v4.m3u8@ . If the output is video, Elastic Transcoder also creates an output file with an extension of @_iframe.m3u8@ : OutputKeyPrefix@Outputs:Key@ _v4.m3u8 OutputKeyPrefix@Outputs:Key@ _iframe.m3u8 OutputKeyPrefix@Outputs:Key@ .ts Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the relevant file extension to the file name. If you include a file extension in Output Key, the file name will have two extensions. If you include more than one output in a playlist, any segment duration settings, clip settings, or caption settings must be the same for all outputs in the playlist. For @Smooth@ playlists, the @Audio:Profile@ , @Video:Profile@ , and @Video:FrameRate@ to @Video:KeyframesMaxDist@ ratio must be the same for all outputs.
--
-- * 'cjpName' - The name that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the master playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8. If the name includes a @/@ character, the section of the name before the last @/@ must be identical for all @Name@ objects. If you create more than one master playlist, the values of all @Name@ objects must be unique.
--
-- * 'cjpHlsContentProtection' - The HLS content protection settings, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder to apply to the output files associated with this playlist.
