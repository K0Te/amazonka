-- | Creates a value of 'AudioCodecOptions' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'acoSigned' - You can only choose whether an audio sample is signed when you specify @pcm@ for the value of Audio:Codec. Whether audio samples are represented with negative and positive numbers (signed) or only positive numbers (unsigned). The supported value is @Signed@ .
--
-- * 'acoBitDepth' - You can only choose an audio bit depth when you specify @flac@ or @pcm@ for the value of Audio:Codec. The bit depth of a sample is how many bits of information are included in the audio samples. The higher the bit depth, the better the audio, but the larger the file. Valid values are @16@ and @24@ . The most common bit depth is @24@ .
--
-- * 'acoProfile' - You can only choose an audio profile when you specify AAC for the value of Audio:Codec. Specify the AAC profile for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:     * @auto@ : If you specify @auto@ , Elastic Transcoder selects the profile based on the bit rate selected for the output file.     * @AAC-LC@ : The most common AAC profile. Use for bit rates larger than 64 kbps.     * @HE-AAC@ : Not supported on some older players and devices. Use for bit rates between 40 and 80 kbps.     * @HE-AACv2@ : Not supported on some players and devices. Use for bit rates less than 48 kbps. All outputs in a @Smooth@ playlist must have the same value for @Profile@ .
--
-- * 'acoBitOrder' - You can only choose an audio bit order when you specify @pcm@ for the value of Audio:Codec. The order the bits of a PCM sample are stored in. The supported value is @LittleEndian@ .
