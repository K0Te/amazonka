-- | Creates a value of 'NodeGroupMember' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ngmCacheClusterId' - The ID of the cluster to which the node belongs.
--
-- * 'ngmCacheNodeId' - The ID of the node within its cluster. A node ID is a numeric identifier (0001, 0002, etc.).
--
-- * 'ngmPreferredAvailabilityZone' - The name of the Availability Zone in which the node is located.
--
-- * 'ngmCurrentRole' - The role that is currently assigned to the node - @primary@ or @replica@ . This member is only applicable for Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication groups.
--
-- * 'ngmPreferredOutpostARN' - The outpost ARN of the node group member.
--
-- * 'ngmReadEndpoint' - The information required for client programs to connect to a node for read operations. The read endpoint is only applicable on Redis (cluster mode disabled) clusters.
