-- Dynamically increases the number of replics in a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group or the number of replica nodes in one or more node groups (shards) of a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. This operation is performed with no cluster down time.

-- * 'ircNewReplicaCount' - The number of read replica nodes you want at the completion of this operation. For Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication groups, this is the number of replica nodes in the replication group.

-- * 'ircReplicationGroupId' - The id of the replication group to which you want to add replica nodes.
--
-- * 'ircApplyImmediately' - If @True@ , the number of replica nodes is increased immediately. @ApplyImmediately=False@ is not currently supported.
