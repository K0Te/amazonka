-- | Creates a value of 'WorkspaceDirectory' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'wdRegistrationCode' - The registration code for the directory. This is the code that users enter in their Amazon WorkSpaces client application to connect to the directory.
--
-- * 'wdIAMRoleId' - The identifier of the IAM role. This is the role that allows Amazon WorkSpaces to make calls to other services, such as Amazon EC2, on your behalf.
--
-- * 'wdDirectoryId' - The directory identifier.
--
-- * 'wdState' - The state of the directory's registration with Amazon WorkSpaces. After a directory is deregistered, the @DEREGISTERED@ state is returned very briefly before the directory metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned. To confirm that a directory is deregistered, check for the directory ID by using <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaceDirectories.html DescribeWorkspaceDirectories> . If the directory ID isn't returned, then the directory has been successfully deregistered.
--
-- * 'wdCustomerUserName' - The user name for the service account.
--
-- * 'wdSubnetIds' - The identifiers of the subnets used with the directory.
--
-- * 'wdIpGroupIds' - The identifiers of the IP access control groups associated with the directory.
--
-- * 'wdAlias' - The directory alias.
--
-- * 'wdWorkspaceSecurityGroupId' - The identifier of the security group that is assigned to new WorkSpaces.
--
-- * 'wdDirectoryType' - The directory type.
--
-- * 'wdTenancy' - Specifies whether the directory is dedicated or shared. To use Bring Your Own License (BYOL), this value must be set to @DEDICATED@ . For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/byol-windows-images.html Bring Your Own Windows Desktop Images> .
--
-- * 'wdWorkspaceCreationProperties' - The default creation properties for all WorkSpaces in the directory.
--
-- * 'wdDNSIPAddresses' - The IP addresses of the DNS servers for the directory.
--
-- * 'wdWorkspaceAccessProperties' - The devices and operating systems that users can use to access WorkSpaces.
--
-- * 'wdDirectoryName' - The name of the directory.
--
-- * 'wdSelfservicePermissions' - The default self-service permissions for WorkSpaces in the directory.
