-- | Creates a value of 'WorkspaceConnectionStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'wcsLastKnownUserConnectionTimestamp' - The timestamp of the last known user connection.
--
-- * 'wcsConnectionStateCheckTimestamp' - The timestamp of the connection status check.
--
-- * 'wcsWorkspaceId' - The identifier of the WorkSpace.
--
-- * 'wcsConnectionState' - The connection state of the WorkSpace. The connection state is unknown if the WorkSpace is stopped.
