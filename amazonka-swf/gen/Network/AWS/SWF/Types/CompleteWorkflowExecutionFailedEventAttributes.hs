-- | Creates a value of 'CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cwefeaCause' - The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.
--
-- * 'cwefeaDecisionTaskCompletedEventId' - The ID of the @DecisionTaskCompleted@ event corresponding to the decision task that resulted in the @CompleteWorkflowExecution@ decision to complete this execution. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
