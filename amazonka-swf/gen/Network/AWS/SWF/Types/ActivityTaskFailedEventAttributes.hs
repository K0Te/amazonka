-- | Creates a value of 'ActivityTaskFailedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

--
-- * 'atfeaReason' - The reason provided for the failure.
--
-- * 'atfeaDetails' - The details of the failure.
--
-- * 'atfeaScheduledEventId' - The ID of the @ActivityTaskScheduled@ event that was recorded when this activity task was scheduled. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
