-- | Creates a value of 'WorkflowExecutionInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'weiParent' - If this workflow execution is a child of another execution then contains the workflow execution that started this execution.
--
-- * 'weiTagList' - The list of tags associated with the workflow execution. Tags can be used to identify and list workflow executions of interest through the visibility APIs. A workflow execution can have a maximum of 5 tags.
--
-- * 'weiCloseStatus' - If the execution status is closed then this specifies how the execution was closed:     * @COMPLETED@ – the execution was successfully completed.     * @CANCELED@ – the execution was canceled.Cancellation allows the implementation to gracefully clean up before the execution is closed.     * @TERMINATED@ – the execution was force terminated.     * @FAILED@ – the execution failed to complete.     * @TIMED_OUT@ – the execution did not complete in the alloted time and was automatically timed out.     * @CONTINUED_AS_NEW@ – the execution is logically continued. This means the current execution was completed and a new execution was started to carry on the workflow.
--
-- * 'weiCloseTimestamp' - The time when the workflow execution was closed. Set only if the execution status is CLOSED.
--
-- * 'weiCancelRequested' - Set to true if a cancellation is requested for this workflow execution.
--
-- * 'weiExecution' - The workflow execution this information is about.
--
-- * 'weiWorkflowType' - The type of the workflow execution.
--
-- * 'weiStartTimestamp' - The time when the execution was started.
--
-- * 'weiExecutionStatus' - The current status of the execution.
