-- | Creates a value of 'WorkflowExecutionCompletedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'weceaResult' - The result produced by the workflow execution upon successful completion.
--
-- * 'weceaDecisionTaskCompletedEventId' - The ID of the @DecisionTaskCompleted@ event corresponding to the decision task that resulted in the @CompleteWorkflowExecution@ decision to complete this execution. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
