-- | Event within a workflow execution. A history event can be one of these types:
--
--
--     * @ActivityTaskCancelRequested@ – A @RequestCancelActivityTask@ decision was received by the system.
--
--     * @ActivityTaskCanceled@ – The activity task was successfully canceled.
--
--     * @ActivityTaskCompleted@ – An activity worker successfully completed an activity task by calling 'RespondActivityTaskCompleted' .
--
--     * @ActivityTaskFailed@ – An activity worker failed an activity task by calling 'RespondActivityTaskFailed' .
--
--     * @ActivityTaskScheduled@ – An activity task was scheduled for execution.
--
--     * @ActivityTaskStarted@ – The scheduled activity task was dispatched to a worker.
--
--     * @ActivityTaskTimedOut@ – The activity task timed out.
--
--     * @CancelTimerFailed@ – Failed to process CancelTimer decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example no timer exists with the specified timer Id.
--
--     * @CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – A request to cancel a workflow execution failed.
--
--     * @ChildWorkflowExecutionCanceled@ – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, was canceled and closed.
--
--     * @ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted@ – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, completed successfully and was closed.
--
--     * @ChildWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, failed to complete successfully and was closed.
--
--     * @ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted@ – A child workflow execution was successfully started.
--
--     * @ChildWorkflowExecutionTerminated@ – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, was terminated.
--
--     * @ChildWorkflowExecutionTimedOut@ – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, timed out and was closed.
--
--     * @CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – The workflow execution failed to complete.
--
--     * @ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – The workflow execution failed to complete after being continued as a new workflow execution.
--
--     * @DecisionTaskCompleted@ – The decider successfully completed a decision task by calling 'RespondDecisionTaskCompleted' .
--
--     * @DecisionTaskScheduled@ – A decision task was scheduled for the workflow execution.
--
--     * @DecisionTaskStarted@ – The decision task was dispatched to a decider.
--
--     * @DecisionTaskTimedOut@ – The decision task timed out.
--
--     * @ExternalWorkflowExecutionCancelRequested@ – Request to cancel an external workflow execution was successfully delivered to the target execution.
--
--     * @ExternalWorkflowExecutionSignaled@ – A signal, requested by this workflow execution, was successfully delivered to the target external workflow execution.
--
--     * @FailWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – A request to mark a workflow execution as failed, itself failed.
--
--     * @MarkerRecorded@ – A marker was recorded in the workflow history as the result of a @RecordMarker@ decision.
--
--     * @RecordMarkerFailed@ – A @RecordMarker@ decision was returned as failed.
--
--     * @RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed@ – Failed to process RequestCancelActivityTask decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly.
--
--     * @RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – Request to cancel an external workflow execution failed.
--
--     * @RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ – A request was made to request the cancellation of an external workflow execution.
--
--     * @ScheduleActivityTaskFailed@ – Failed to process ScheduleActivityTask decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example the activity type specified isn't registered.
--
--     * @SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – The request to signal an external workflow execution failed.
--
--     * @SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ – A request to signal an external workflow was made.
--
--     * @StartActivityTaskFailed@ – A scheduled activity task failed to start.
--
--     * @StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed@ – Failed to process StartChildWorkflowExecution decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example the workflow type specified isn't registered.
--
--     * @StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ – A request was made to start a child workflow execution.
--
--     * @StartTimerFailed@ – Failed to process StartTimer decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example a timer already exists with the specified timer Id.
--
--     * @TimerCanceled@ – A timer, previously started for this workflow execution, was successfully canceled.
--
--     * @TimerFired@ – A timer, previously started for this workflow execution, fired.
--
--     * @TimerStarted@ – A timer was started for the workflow execution due to a @StartTimer@ decision.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested@ – A request to cancel this workflow execution was made.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionCanceled@ – The workflow execution was successfully canceled and closed.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionCompleted@ – The workflow execution was closed due to successful completion.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew@ – The workflow execution was closed and a new execution of the same type was created with the same workflowId.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionFailed@ – The workflow execution closed due to a failure.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionSignaled@ – An external signal was received for the workflow execution.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionStarted@ – The workflow execution was started.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionTerminated@ – The workflow execution was terminated.
--
--     * @WorkflowExecutionTimedOut@ – The workflow execution was closed because a time out was exceeded.
