-- * 'cwefeaInitiatedEventId' - The ID of the @StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ event corresponding to the @StartChildWorkflowExecution@ 'Decision' to start this child workflow execution. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
