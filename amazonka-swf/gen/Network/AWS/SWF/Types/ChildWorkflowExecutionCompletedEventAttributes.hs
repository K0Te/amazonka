-- | Creates a value of 'ChildWorkflowExecutionCompletedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cweceaResult' - The result of the child workflow execution.
--
-- * 'cweceaWorkflowExecution' - The child workflow execution that was completed.
--
-- * 'cweceaWorkflowType' - The type of the child workflow execution.
--
-- * 'cweceaInitiatedEventId' - The ID of the @StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ event corresponding to the @StartChildWorkflowExecution@ 'Decision' to start this child workflow execution. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
--
-- * 'cweceaStartedEventId' - The ID of the @ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted@ event recorded when this child workflow execution was started. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
