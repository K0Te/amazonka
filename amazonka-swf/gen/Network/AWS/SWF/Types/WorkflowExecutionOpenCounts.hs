-- | Creates a value of 'WorkflowExecutionOpenCounts' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'weocOpenLambdaFunctions' - The count of Lambda tasks whose status is @OPEN@ .
--
-- * 'weocOpenActivityTasks' - The count of activity tasks whose status is @OPEN@ .
--
-- * 'weocOpenDecisionTasks' - The count of decision tasks whose status is OPEN. A workflow execution can have at most one open decision task.
--
-- * 'weocOpenTimers' - The count of timers started by this workflow execution that have not fired yet.
--
-- * 'weocOpenChildWorkflowExecutions' - The count of child workflow executions whose status is @OPEN@ .
