-- | Creates a value of 'WorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'wefeaReason' - The descriptive reason provided for the failure.
--
-- * 'wefeaDetails' - The details of the failure.
--
-- * 'wefeaDecisionTaskCompletedEventId' - The ID of the @DecisionTaskCompleted@ event corresponding to the decision task that resulted in the @FailWorkflowExecution@ decision to fail this execution. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
