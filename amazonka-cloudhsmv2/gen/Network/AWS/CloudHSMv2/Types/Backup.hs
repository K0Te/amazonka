-- | Contains information about a backup of an AWS CloudHSM cluster. All backup objects contain the @BackupId@ , @BackupState@ , @ClusterId@ , and @CreateTimestamp@ parameters. Backups that were copied into a destination region additionally contain the @CopyTimestamp@ , @SourceBackup@ , @SourceCluster@ , and @SourceRegion@ parameters. A backup that is pending deletion will include the @DeleteTimestamp@ parameter.

-- | Creates a value of 'Backup' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bDeleteTimestamp' - The date and time when the backup will be permanently deleted.
--
-- * 'bSourceCluster' - The identifier (ID) of the cluster containing the source backup from which the new backup was copied.
--
-- * 'bNeverExpires' - Specifies whether the service should exempt a backup from the retention policy for the cluster. @True@ exempts a backup from the retention policy. @False@ means the service applies the backup retention policy defined at the cluster.
--
-- * 'bSourceRegion' - The AWS Region that contains the source backup from which the new backup was copied.
--
-- * 'bTagList' - The list of tags for the backup.
--
-- * 'bSourceBackup' - The identifier (ID) of the source backup from which the new backup was copied.
--
-- * 'bClusterId' - The identifier (ID) of the cluster that was backed up.
--
-- * 'bCreateTimestamp' - The date and time when the backup was created.
--
-- * 'bCopyTimestamp' - The date and time when the backup was copied from a source backup.
--
-- * 'bBackupState' - The state of the backup.
--
-- * 'bBackupId' - The identifier (ID) of the backup.
