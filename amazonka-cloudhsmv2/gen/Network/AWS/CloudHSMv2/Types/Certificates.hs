-- | Creates a value of 'Certificates' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cManufacturerHardwareCertificate' - The HSM hardware certificate issued (signed) by the hardware manufacturer.
--
-- * 'cClusterCSR' - The cluster's certificate signing request (CSR). The CSR exists only when the cluster's state is @UNINITIALIZED@ .
--
-- * 'cHSMCertificate' - The HSM certificate issued (signed) by the HSM hardware.
--
-- * 'cClusterCertificate' - The cluster certificate issued (signed) by the issuing certificate authority (CA) of the cluster's owner.
--
-- * 'cAWSHardwareCertificate' - The HSM hardware certificate issued (signed) by AWS CloudHSM.
