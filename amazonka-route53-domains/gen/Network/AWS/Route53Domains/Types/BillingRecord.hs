-- | Creates a value of 'BillingRecord' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'brOperation' - The operation that you were charged for.
--
-- * 'brInvoiceId' - The ID of the invoice that is associated with the billing record.
--
-- * 'brDomainName' - The name of the domain that the billing record applies to. If the domain name contains characters other than a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen), such as an internationalized domain name, then this value is in Punycode. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html DNS Domain Name Format> in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'brBillDate' - The date that the operation was billed, in Unix format.
--
-- * 'brPrice' - The price that you were charged for the operation, in US dollars. Example value: 12.0
