-- | Creates a value of 'DomainSuggestion' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dAvailability' - Whether the domain name is available for registering. Valid values:     * AVAILABLE    * The domain name is available.     * AVAILABLE_RESERVED    * The domain name is reserved under specific conditions.     * AVAILABLE_PREORDER    * The domain name is available and can be preordered.     * DONT_KNOW    * The TLD registry didn't reply with a definitive answer about whether the domain name is available. Route 53 can return this response for a variety of reasons, for example, the registry is performing maintenance. Try again later.     * PENDING    * The TLD registry didn't return a response in the expected amount of time. When the response is delayed, it usually takes just a few extra seconds. You can resubmit the request immediately.     * RESERVED    * The domain name has been reserved for another person or organization.     * UNAVAILABLE    * The domain name is not available.     * UNAVAILABLE_PREMIUM    * The domain name is not available.     * UNAVAILABLE_RESTRICTED    * The domain name is forbidden.
--
-- * 'dDomainName' - A suggested domain name.
