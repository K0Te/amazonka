-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'eValue' - The value of the exported output, such as a resource physical ID. This value is defined in the @Export@ field in the associated stack's @Outputs@ section.
--
-- * 'eExportingStackId' - The stack that contains the exported output name and value.
--
-- * 'eName' - The name of exported output value. Use this name and the @Fn::ImportValue@ function to import the associated value into other stacks. The name is defined in the @Export@ field in the associated stack's @Outputs@ section.
