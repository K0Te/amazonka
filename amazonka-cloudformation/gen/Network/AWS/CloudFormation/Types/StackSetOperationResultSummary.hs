-- | Creates a value of 'StackSetOperationResultSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ssorsStatus' - The result status of the stack set operation for the given account in the given Region.     * @CANCELLED@ : The operation in the specified account and Region has been cancelled. This is either because a user has stopped the stack set operation, or because the failure tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.     * @FAILED@ : The operation in the specified account and Region failed.  If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.      * @RUNNING@ : The operation in the specified account and Region is currently in progress.     * @PENDING@ : The operation in the specified account and Region has yet to start.      * @SUCCEEDED@ : The operation in the specified account and Region completed successfully.
--
-- * 'ssorsAccount' - [@Self-managed@ permissions] The name of the AWS account for this operation result.
--
-- * 'ssorsAccountGateResult' - The results of the account gate function AWS CloudFormation invokes, if present, before proceeding with stack set operations in an account
--
-- * 'ssorsOrganizationalUnitId' - [@Service-managed@ permissions] The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs that you specified for <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentTargets.html DeploymentTargets> .
--
-- * 'ssorsRegion' - The name of the AWS Region for this operation result.
--
-- * 'ssorsStatusReason' - The reason for the assigned result status.
