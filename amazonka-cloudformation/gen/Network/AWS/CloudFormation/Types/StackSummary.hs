-- | Creates a value of 'StackSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ssLastUpdatedTime' - The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned if the stack has been updated at least once.
--
-- * 'ssRootId' - For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the stack ID of the top-level stack to which the nested stack ultimately belongs. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html Working with Nested Stacks> in the /AWS CloudFormation User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'ssStackStatusReason' - Success/Failure message associated with the stack status.
--
-- * 'ssTemplateDescription' - The template description of the template used to create the stack.
--
-- * 'ssDriftInformation' - Summarizes information on whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has /drifted/ , from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources> .
--
-- * 'ssDeletionTime' - The time the stack was deleted.
--
-- * 'ssStackId' - Unique stack identifier.
--
-- * 'ssParentId' - For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the stack ID of the direct parent of this stack. For the first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the parent stack. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html Working with Nested Stacks> in the /AWS CloudFormation User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'ssStackName' - The name associated with the stack.
--
-- * 'ssCreationTime' - The time the stack was created.
--
-- * 'ssStackStatus' - The current status of the stack.
