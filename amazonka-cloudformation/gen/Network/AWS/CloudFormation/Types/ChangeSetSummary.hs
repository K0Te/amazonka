-- | Creates a value of 'ChangeSetSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cCreationTime' - The start time when the change set was created, in UTC.
--
-- * 'cStatus' - The state of the change set, such as @CREATE_IN_PROGRESS@ , @CREATE_COMPLETE@ , or @FAILED@ .
--
-- * 'cParentChangeSetId' - The parent change set ID.
--
-- * 'cChangeSetName' - The name of the change set.
--
-- * 'cExecutionStatus' - If the change set execution status is @AVAILABLE@ , you can execute the change set. If you can’t execute the change set, the status indicates why. For example, a change set might be in an @UNAVAILABLE@ state because AWS CloudFormation is still creating it or in an @OBSOLETE@ state because the stack was already updated.
--
-- * 'cChangeSetId' - The ID of the change set.
--
-- * 'cIncludeNestedStacks' - Specifies the current setting of @IncludeNestedStacks@ for the change set.
--
-- * 'cRootChangeSetId' - The root change set ID.
--
-- * 'cStatusReason' - A description of the change set's status. For example, if your change set is in the @FAILED@ state, AWS CloudFormation shows the error message.
--
-- * 'cStackId' - The ID of the stack with which the change set is associated.
--
-- * 'cDescription' - Descriptive information about the change set.
--
-- * 'cStackName' - The name of the stack with which the change set is associated.
