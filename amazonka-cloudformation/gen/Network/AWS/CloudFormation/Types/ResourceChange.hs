-- | Creates a value of 'ResourceChange' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rcLogicalResourceId' - The resource's logical ID, which is defined in the stack's template.
--
-- * 'rcPhysicalResourceId' - The resource's physical ID (resource name). Resources that you are adding don't have physical IDs because they haven't been created.
--
-- * 'rcResourceType' - The type of AWS CloudFormation resource, such as @AWS::S3::Bucket@ .
--
-- * 'rcAction' - The action that AWS CloudFormation takes on the resource, such as @Add@ (adds a new resource), @Modify@ (changes a resource), @Remove@ (deletes a resource), @Import@ (imports a resource), or @Dynamic@ (exact action for the resource cannot be determined).
--
-- * 'rcChangeSetId' - The change set ID of the nested change set.
--
-- * 'rcModuleInfo' - Contains information about the module from which the resource was created, if the resource was created from a module included in the stack template.
--
-- * 'rcScope' - For the @Modify@ action, indicates which resource attribute is triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute's @Metadata@ , @Properties@ , or @Tags@ .
--
-- * 'rcDetails' - For the @Modify@ action, a list of @ResourceChangeDetail@ structures that describes the changes that AWS CloudFormation will make to the resource. 
--
-- * 'rcReplacement' - For the @Modify@ action, indicates whether AWS CloudFormation will replace the resource by creating a new one and deleting the old one. This value depends on the value of the @RequiresRecreation@ property in the @ResourceTargetDefinition@ structure. For example, if the @RequiresRecreation@ field is @Always@ and the @Evaluation@ field is @Static@ , @Replacement@ is @True@ . If the @RequiresRecreation@ field is @Always@ and the @Evaluation@ field is @Dynamic@ , @Replacement@ is @Conditionally@ . If you have multiple changes with different @RequiresRecreation@ values, the @Replacement@ value depends on the change with the most impact. A @RequiresRecreation@ value of @Always@ has the most impact, followed by @Conditionally@ , and then @Never@ .
