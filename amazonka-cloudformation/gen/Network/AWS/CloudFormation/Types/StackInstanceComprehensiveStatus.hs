-- | Creates a value of 'StackInstanceComprehensiveStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sicsDetailedStatus' -     * @CANCELLED@ : The operation in the specified account and Region has been cancelled. This is either because a user has stopped the stack set operation, or because the failure tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.     * @FAILED@ : The operation in the specified account and Region failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.     * @INOPERABLE@ : A @DeleteStackInstances@ operation has failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further @UpdateStackSet@ operations. You might need to perform a @DeleteStackInstances@ operation, with @RetainStacks@ set to @true@ , to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.     * @PENDING@ : The operation in the specified account and Region has yet to start.     * @RUNNING@ : The operation in the specified account and Region is currently in progress.     * @SUCCEEDED@ : The operation in the specified account and Region completed successfully.
