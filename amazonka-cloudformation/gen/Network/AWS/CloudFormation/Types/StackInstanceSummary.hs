-- | Creates a value of 'StackInstanceSummary' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sisStatus' - The status of the stack instance, in terms of its synchronization with its associated stack set.     * @INOPERABLE@ : A @DeleteStackInstances@ operation has failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further @UpdateStackSet@ operations. You might need to perform a @DeleteStackInstances@ operation, with @RetainStacks@ set to @true@ , to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.     * @OUTDATED@ : The stack isn't currently up to date with the stack set because:     * The associated stack failed during a @CreateStackSet@ or @UpdateStackSet@ operation.      * The stack was part of a @CreateStackSet@ or @UpdateStackSet@ operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was created or updated.      * @CURRENT@ : The stack is currently up to date with the stack set.
--
-- * 'sisLastDriftCheckTimestamp' - Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection operation on the stack instance. This value will be @NULL@ for any stack instance on which drift detection has not yet been performed.
--
-- * 'sisAccount' - [@Self-managed@ permissions] The name of the AWS account that the stack instance is associated with.
--
-- * 'sisDriftStatus' - Status of the stack instance's actual configuration compared to the expected template and parameter configuration of the stack set to which it belongs.      * @DRIFTED@ : The stack differs from the expected template and parameter configuration of the stack set to which it belongs. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associated stack have drifted.     * @NOT_CHECKED@ : AWS CloudFormation has not checked if the stack instance differs from its expected stack set configuration.     * @IN_SYNC@ : The stack instance's actual configuration matches its expected stack set configuration.     * @UNKNOWN@ : This value is reserved for future use.
--
-- * 'sisOrganizationalUnitId' - [@Service-managed@ permissions] The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs that you specified for <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentTargets.html DeploymentTargets> .
--
-- * 'sisRegion' - The name of the AWS Region that the stack instance is associated with.
--
-- * 'sisStatusReason' - The explanation for the specific status code assigned to this stack instance.
--
-- * 'sisStackId' - The ID of the stack instance.
--
-- * 'sisStackInstanceStatus' - The detailed status of the stack instance.
--
-- * 'sisStackSetId' - The name or unique ID of the stack set that the stack instance is associated with.
