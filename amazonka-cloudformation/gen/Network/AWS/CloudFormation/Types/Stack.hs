-- | Creates a value of 'Stack' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'staDisableRollback' - Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures:     * @true@ : disable rollback     * @false@ : enable rollback
--
-- * 'staLastUpdatedTime' - The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned if the stack has been updated at least once.
--
-- * 'staRootId' - For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the stack ID of the top-level stack to which the nested stack ultimately belongs. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html Working with Nested Stacks> in the /AWS CloudFormation User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'staNotificationARNs' - SNS topic ARNs to which stack related events are published.
--
-- * 'staStackStatusReason' - Success/failure message associated with the stack status.
--
-- * 'staEnableTerminationProtection' - Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack. For <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html nested stacks> , termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted> in the /AWS CloudFormation User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'staDriftInformation' - Information on whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has /drifted/ , from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources> .
--
-- * 'staChangeSetId' - The unique ID of the change set.
--
-- * 'staDeletionTime' - The time the stack was deleted.
--
-- * 'staOutputs' - A list of output structures.
--
-- * 'staParameters' - A list of @Parameter@ structures.
--
-- * 'staStackId' - Unique identifier of the stack.
--
-- * 'staDescription' - A user-defined description associated with the stack.
--
-- * 'staCapabilities' - The capabilities allowed in the stack.
--
-- * 'staRollbackConfiguration' - The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
--
-- * 'staTags' - A list of @Tag@ s that specify information about the stack.
--
-- * 'staTimeoutInMinutes' - The amount of time within which stack creation should complete.
--
-- * 'staParentId' - For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the stack ID of the direct parent of this stack. For the first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the parent stack. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html Working with Nested Stacks> in the /AWS CloudFormation User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'staRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is associated with the stack. During a stack operation, AWS CloudFormation uses this role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.
--
-- * 'staStackName' - The name associated with the stack.
--
-- * 'staCreationTime' - The time at which the stack was created.
--
-- * 'staStackStatus' - Current status of the stack.
