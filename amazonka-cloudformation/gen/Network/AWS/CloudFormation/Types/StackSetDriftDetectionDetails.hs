-- | Creates a value of 'StackSetDriftDetectionDetails' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ssdddLastDriftCheckTimestamp' - Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection operation on the stack set. This value will be @NULL@ for any stack set on which drift detection has not yet been performed.
--
-- * 'ssdddTotalStackInstancesCount' - The total number of stack instances belonging to this stack set.  The total number of stack instances is equal to the total of:     * Stack instances that match the stack set configuration.      * Stack instances that have drifted from the stack set configuration.      * Stack instances where the drift detection operation has failed.     * Stack instances currently being checked for drift.
--
-- * 'ssdddInProgressStackInstancesCount' - The number of stack instances that are currently being checked for drift.
--
-- * 'ssdddDriftedStackInstancesCount' - The number of stack instances that have drifted from the expected template and parameter configuration of the stack set. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associated stack do not match their expected configuration.
--
-- * 'ssdddDriftDetectionStatus' - The status of the stack set drift detection operation.     * @COMPLETED@ : The drift detection operation completed without failing on any stack instances.     * @FAILED@ : The drift detection operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance.      * @PARTIAL_SUCCESS@ : The drift detection operation completed without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.     * @IN_PROGRESS@ : The drift detection operation is currently being performed.     * @STOPPED@ : The user has cancelled the drift detection operation.
--
-- * 'ssdddDriftStatus' - Status of the stack set's actual configuration compared to its expected template and parameter configuration. A stack set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack instances have drifted from their expected template and parameter configuration.     * @DRIFTED@ : One or more of the stack instances belonging to the stack set stack differs from the expected template and parameter configuration. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associated stack have drifted.     * @NOT_CHECKED@ : AWS CloudFormation has not checked the stack set for drift.     * @IN_SYNC@ : All of the stack instances belonging to the stack set stack match from the expected template and parameter configuration.
--
-- * 'ssdddFailedStackInstancesCount' - The number of stack instances for which the drift detection operation failed.
--
-- * 'ssdddInSyncStackInstancesCount' - The number of stack instances which match the expected template and parameter configuration of the stack set.
