-- | Creates a value of 'KinesisSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'kIncludeTransactionDetails' - Provides detailed transaction information from the source database. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log position, and values for @transaction_id@ , previous @transaction_id@ , and @transaction_record_id@ (the record offset within a transaction). The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'kIncludeTableAlterOperations' - Includes any data definition language (DDL) operations that change the table in the control data, such as @rename-table@ , @drop-table@ , @add-column@ , @drop-column@ , and @rename-column@ . The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'kServiceAccessRoleARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS DMS uses to write to the Kinesis data stream.
--
-- * 'kPartitionIncludeSchemaTable' - Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the partition type is @primary-key-type@ . Doing this increases data distribution among Kinesis shards. For example, suppose that a SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each table has only limited range for a primary key. In this case, the same primary key is sent from thousands of tables to the same shard, which causes throttling. The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'kStreamARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams endpoint.
--
-- * 'kIncludeControlDetails' - Shows detailed control information for table definition, column definition, and table and column changes in the Kinesis message output. The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'kIncludePartitionValue' - Shows the partition value within the Kinesis message output, unless the partition type is @schema-table-type@ . The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'kMessageFormat' - The output format for the records created on the endpoint. The message format is @JSON@ (default) or @JSON_UNFORMATTED@ (a single line with no tab).
--
-- * 'kIncludeNullAndEmpty' - Include NULL and empty columns for records migrated to the endpoint. The default is @false@ .
