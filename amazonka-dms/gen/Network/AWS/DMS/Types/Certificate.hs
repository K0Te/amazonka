-- | Creates a value of 'Certificate' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cCertificateOwner' - The owner of the certificate.
--
-- * 'cSigningAlgorithm' - The signing algorithm for the certificate.
--
-- * 'cValidFromDate' - The beginning date that the certificate is valid.
--
-- * 'cCertificatePem' - The contents of a @.pem@ file, which contains an X.509 certificate.
--
-- * 'cCertificateARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the certificate.
--
-- * 'cCertificateCreationDate' - The date that the certificate was created.
--
-- * 'cCertificateIdentifier' - A customer-assigned name for the certificate. Identifiers must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens. They can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
--
-- * 'cCertificateWallet' - The location of an imported Oracle Wallet certificate for use with SSL.-- /Note:/ This 'Lens' automatically encodes and decodes Base64 data. The underlying isomorphism will encode to Base64 representation during serialisation, and decode from Base64 representation during deserialisation. This 'Lens' accepts and returns only raw unencoded data.
--
-- * 'cKeyLength' - The key length of the cryptographic algorithm being used.
--
-- * 'cValidToDate' - The final date that the certificate is valid.
