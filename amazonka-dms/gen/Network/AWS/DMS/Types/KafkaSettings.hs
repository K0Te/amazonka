-- | Creates a value of 'KafkaSettings' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ksIncludeTransactionDetails' - Provides detailed transaction information from the source database. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log position, and values for @transaction_id@ , previous @transaction_id@ , and @transaction_record_id@ (the record offset within a transaction). The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'ksIncludeTableAlterOperations' - Includes any data definition language (DDL) operations that change the table in the control data, such as @rename-table@ , @drop-table@ , @add-column@ , @drop-column@ , and @rename-column@ . The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'ksPartitionIncludeSchemaTable' - Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the partition type is @primary-key-type@ . Doing this increases data distribution among Kafka partitions. For example, suppose that a SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each table has only limited range for a primary key. In this case, the same primary key is sent from thousands of tables to the same partition, which causes throttling. The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'ksTopic' - The topic to which you migrate the data. If you don't specify a topic, AWS DMS specifies @"kafka-default-topic"@ as the migration topic.
--
-- * 'ksIncludeControlDetails' - Shows detailed control information for table definition, column definition, and table and column changes in the Kafka message output. The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'ksIncludePartitionValue' - Shows the partition value within the Kafka message output, unless the partition type is @schema-table-type@ . The default is @false@ .
--
-- * 'ksMessageFormat' - The output format for the records created on the endpoint. The message format is @JSON@ (default) or @JSON_UNFORMATTED@ (a single line with no tab).
--
-- * 'ksBroker' - The broker location and port of the Kafka broker that hosts your Kafka instance. Specify the broker in the form @/broker-hostname-or-ip/ :/port/ @ . For example, @"ec2-12-345-678-901.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2345"@ .
--
-- * 'ksMessageMaxBytes' - The maximum size in bytes for records created on the endpoint The default is 1,000,000.
--
-- * 'ksIncludeNullAndEmpty' - Include NULL and empty columns for records migrated to the endpoint. The default is @false@ .
