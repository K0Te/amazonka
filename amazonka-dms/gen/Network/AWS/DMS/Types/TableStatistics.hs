-- | Creates a value of 'TableStatistics' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tsValidationState' - The validation state of the table. This parameter can have the following values:     * Not enabled – Validation isn't enabled for the table in the migration task.     * Pending records – Some records in the table are waiting for validation.     * Mismatched records – Some records in the table don't match between the source and target.     * Suspended records – Some records in the table couldn't be validated.     * No primary key –The table couldn't be validated because it has no primary key.     * Table error – The table wasn't validated because it's in an error state and some data wasn't migrated.     * Validated – All rows in the table are validated. If the table is updated, the status can change from Validated.     * Error – The table couldn't be validated because of an unexpected error.     * Pending validation – The table is waiting validation.     * Preparing table – Preparing the table enabled in the migration task for validation.     * Pending revalidation – All rows in the table are pending validation after the table was updated.
--
-- * 'tsFullLoadRows' - The number of rows added during the full load operation.
--
-- * 'tsInserts' - The number of insert actions performed on a table.
--
-- * 'tsFullLoadEndTime' - The time when the full load operation completed.
--
-- * 'tsFullLoadCondtnlChkFailedRows' - The number of rows that failed conditional checks during the full load operation (valid only for migrations where DynamoDB is the target).
--
-- * 'tsFullLoadReloaded' - A value that indicates if the table was reloaded (@true@ ) or loaded as part of a new full load operation (@false@ ).
--
-- * 'tsValidationFailedRecords' - The number of records that failed validation.
--
-- * 'tsValidationSuspendedRecords' - The number of records that couldn't be validated.
--
-- * 'tsSchemaName' - The schema name.
--
-- * 'tsValidationStateDetails' - Additional details about the state of validation.
--
-- * 'tsTableState' - The state of the tables described. Valid states: Table does not exist | Before load | Full load | Table completed | Table cancelled | Table error | Table all | Table updates | Table is being reloaded
--
-- * 'tsFullLoadErrorRows' - The number of rows that failed to load during the full load operation (valid only for migrations where DynamoDB is the target).
--
-- * 'tsDdls' - The data definition language (DDL) used to build and modify the structure of your tables.
--
-- * 'tsDeletes' - The number of delete actions performed on a table.
--
-- * 'tsUpdates' - The number of update actions performed on a table.
--
-- * 'tsValidationPendingRecords' - The number of records that have yet to be validated.
--
-- * 'tsFullLoadStartTime' - The time when the full load operation started.
--
-- * 'tsLastUpdateTime' - The last time a table was updated.
--
-- * 'tsTableName' - The name of the table.
