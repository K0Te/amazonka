-- * 'repStatus' - The status of the replication task. This response parameter can return one of the following values:     * @"moving"@ – The task is being moved in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_MoveReplicationTask.html @MoveReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"creating"@ – The task is being created in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationTask.html @CreateReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"deleting"@ – The task is being deleted in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteReplicationTask.html @DeleteReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"failed"@ – The task failed to successfully complete the database migration in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html @StartReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"failed-move"@ – The task failed to move in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_MoveReplicationTask.html @MoveReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"modifying"@ – The task definition is being modified in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyReplicationTask.html @ModifyReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"ready"@ – The task is in a @ready@ state where it can respond to other task operations, such as <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html @StartReplicationTask@ > or <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteReplicationTask.html @DeleteReplicationTask@ > .      * @"running"@ – The task is performing a database migration in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html @StartReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"starting"@ – The task is preparing to perform a database migration in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html @StartReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"stopped"@ – The task has stopped in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StopReplicationTask.html @StopReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"stopping"@ – The task is preparing to stop in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StopReplicationTask.html @StopReplicationTask@ > operation.     * @"testing"@ – The database migration specified for this task is being tested in response to running either the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html @StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun@ > or the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html @StartReplicationTaskAssessment@ > operation.

--
-- * 'repTableMappings' - Table mappings specified in the task.
--
-- * 'repTargetReplicationInstanceARN' - The ARN of the replication instance to which this task is moved in response to running the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_MoveReplicationTask.html @MoveReplicationTask@ > operation. Otherwise, this response parameter isn't a member of the @ReplicationTask@ object.
--
-- * 'repReplicationTaskCreationDate' - The date the replication task was created.
--
-- * 'repMigrationType' - The type of migration.
--
-- * 'repReplicationTaskARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Tasks.TaskData.html Specifying Supplemental Data for Task Settings> in the /AWS Database Migration Service User Guide./ 
--
-- * 'repCdcStopPosition' - Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to stop. The value can be either server time or commit time. Server time example: --cdc-stop-position “server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12” Commit time example: --cdc-stop-position “commit_time: 2018-02-09T12:12:12 “
