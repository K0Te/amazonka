-- | Creates a value of 'DeploymentCommand' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dcArgs' - The arguments of those commands that take arguments. It should be set to a JSON object with the following format: @{"arg_name1" : ["value1", "value2", ...], "arg_name2" : ["value1", "value2", ...], ...}@  The @update_dependencies@ command takes two arguments:     * @upgrade_os_to@ - Specifies the desired Amazon Linux version for instances whose OS you want to upgrade, such as @Amazon Linux 2016.09@ . You must also set the @allow_reboot@ argument to true.     * @allow_reboot@ - Specifies whether to allow AWS OpsWorks Stacks to reboot the instances if necessary, after installing the updates. This argument can be set to either @true@ or @false@ . The default value is @false@ . For example, to upgrade an instance to Amazon Linux 2016.09, set @Args@ to the following. @{ "upgrade_os_to":["Amazon Linux 2016.09"], "allow_reboot":["true"] } @ 
--
-- * 'dcName' - Specifies the operation. You can specify only one command. For stacks, the following commands are available:     * @execute_recipes@ : Execute one or more recipes. To specify the recipes, set an @Args@ parameter named @recipes@ to the list of recipes to be executed. For example, to execute @phpapp::appsetup@ , set @Args@ to @{"recipes":["phpapp::appsetup"]}@ .     * @install_dependencies@ : Install the stack's dependencies.     * @update_custom_cookbooks@ : Update the stack's custom cookbooks.     * @update_dependencies@ : Update the stack's dependencies. For apps, the following commands are available:     * @deploy@ : Deploy an app. Ruby on Rails apps have an optional @Args@ parameter named @migrate@ . Set @Args@ to {"migrate":["true"]} to migrate the database. The default setting is {"migrate":["false"]}.     * @rollback@ Roll the app back to the previous version. When you update an app, AWS OpsWorks Stacks stores the previous version, up to a maximum of five versions. You can use this command to roll an app back as many as four versions.     * @start@ : Start the app's web or application server.     * @stop@ : Stop the app's web or application server.     * @restart@ : Restart the app's web or application server.     * @undeploy@ : Undeploy the app.
