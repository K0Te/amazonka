-- | Creates a value of 'CloudWatchLogsLogStream' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cwllsBatchCount' - Specifies the max number of log events in a batch, up to 10000. The default value is 1000.
--
-- * 'cwllsFileFingerprintLines' - Specifies the range of lines for identifying a file. The valid values are one number, or two dash-delimited numbers, such as '1', '2-5'. The default value is '1', meaning the first line is used to calculate the fingerprint. Fingerprint lines are not sent to CloudWatch Logs unless all specified lines are available.
--
-- * 'cwllsBufferDuration' - Specifies the time duration for the batching of log events. The minimum value is 5000ms and default value is 5000ms.
--
-- * 'cwllsBatchSize' - Specifies the maximum size of log events in a batch, in bytes, up to 1048576 bytes. The default value is 32768 bytes. This size is calculated as the sum of all event messages in UTF-8, plus 26 bytes for each log event.
--
-- * 'cwllsLogGroupName' - Specifies the destination log group. A log group is created automatically if it doesn't already exist. Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long. Allowed characters include a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward slash), and '.' (period).
--
-- * 'cwllsMultiLineStartPattern' - Specifies the pattern for identifying the start of a log message.
--
-- * 'cwllsInitialPosition' - Specifies where to start to read data (start_of_file or end_of_file). The default is start_of_file. This setting is only used if there is no state persisted for that log stream.
--
-- * 'cwllsDatetimeFormat' - Specifies how the time stamp is extracted from logs. For more information, see the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AgentReference.html CloudWatch Logs Agent Reference> .
--
-- * 'cwllsEncoding' - Specifies the encoding of the log file so that the file can be read correctly. The default is @utf_8@ . Encodings supported by Python @codecs.decode()@ can be used here.
--
-- * 'cwllsTimeZone' - Specifies the time zone of log event time stamps.
--
-- * 'cwllsFile' - Specifies log files that you want to push to CloudWatch Logs. @File@ can point to a specific file or multiple files (by using wild card characters such as @/var/log/system.log*@ ). Only the latest file is pushed to CloudWatch Logs, based on file modification time. We recommend that you use wild card characters to specify a series of files of the same type, such as @access_log.2014-06-01-01@ , @access_log.2014-06-01-02@ , and so on by using a pattern like @access_log.*@ . Don't use a wildcard to match multiple file types, such as @access_log_80@ and @access_log_443@ . To specify multiple, different file types, add another log stream entry to the configuration file, so that each log file type is stored in a different log group. Zipped files are not supported.
