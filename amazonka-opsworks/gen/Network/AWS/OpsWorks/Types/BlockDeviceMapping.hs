-- | Creates a value of 'BlockDeviceMapping' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bdmVirtualName' - The virtual device name. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_BlockDeviceMapping.html BlockDeviceMapping> .
--
-- * 'bdmNoDevice' - Suppresses the specified device included in the AMI's block device mapping.
--
-- * 'bdmEBS' - An @EBSBlockDevice@ that defines how to configure an Amazon EBS volume when the instance is launched.
--
-- * 'bdmDeviceName' - The device name that is exposed to the instance, such as @/dev/sdh@ . For the root device, you can use the explicit device name or you can set this parameter to @ROOT_DEVICE@ and AWS OpsWorks Stacks will provide the correct device name.
