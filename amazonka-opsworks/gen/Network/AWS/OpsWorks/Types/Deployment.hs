-- | Creates a value of 'Deployment' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dDeploymentId' - The deployment ID.
--
-- * 'dStatus' - The deployment status:     * running     * successful     * failed
--
-- * 'dCommand' - Used to specify a stack or deployment command.
--
-- * 'dCreatedAt' - Date when the deployment was created.
--
-- * 'dCustomJSON' - A string that contains user-defined custom JSON. It can be used to override the corresponding default stack configuration attribute values for stack or to pass data to recipes. The string should be in the following format: @"{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}"@  For more information on custom JSON, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingstacks-json.html Use Custom JSON to Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes> .
--
-- * 'dIAMUserARN' - The user's IAM ARN.
--
-- * 'dAppId' - The app ID.
--
-- * 'dInstanceIds' - The IDs of the target instances.
--
-- * 'dCompletedAt' - Date when the deployment completed.
--
-- * 'dStackId' - The stack ID.
--
-- * 'dComment' - A user-defined comment.
--
-- * 'dDuration' - The deployment duration.
