-- | Creates a value of 'TemporaryCredential' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tcInstanceId' - The instance's AWS OpsWorks Stacks ID.
--
-- * 'tcUsername' - The user name.
--
-- * 'tcPassword' - The password.
--
-- * 'tcValidForInMinutes' - The length of time (in minutes) that the grant is valid. When the grant expires, at the end of this period, the user will no longer be able to use the credentials to log in. If they are logged in at the time, they will be automatically logged out.
