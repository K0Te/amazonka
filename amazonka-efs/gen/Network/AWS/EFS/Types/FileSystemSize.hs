import Network.AWS.Lens

-- | The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its @Value@ field, and the time at which that size was determined in its @Timestamp@ field. The value doesn't represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file system. That is, the value represents the actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not necessarily the exact size the file system was at any instant in time.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fssValueInIA' - The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Infrequent Access storage class.
--
-- * 'fssValueInStandard' - The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Standard storage class.

-- * 'fssTimestamp' - The time at which the size of data, returned in the @Value@ field, was determined. The value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

-- * 'fssValue' - The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system.
