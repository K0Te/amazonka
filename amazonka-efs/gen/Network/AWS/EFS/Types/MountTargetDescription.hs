-- | Creates a value of 'MountTargetDescription' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mtdIPAddress' - Address at which the file system can be mounted by using the mount target.
--
-- * 'mtdAvailabilityZoneId' - The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the mount target resides in. For example, @use1-az1@ is an AZ ID for the us-east-1 Region and it has the same location in every AWS account.
--
-- * 'mtdVPCId' - The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) ID that the mount target is configured in.
--
-- * 'mtdAvailabilityZoneName' - The name of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the mount target resides in. AZs are independently mapped to names for each AWS account. For example, the Availability Zone @us-east-1a@ for your AWS account might not be the same location as @us-east-1a@ for another AWS account.
--
-- * 'mtdNetworkInterfaceId' - The ID of the network interface that Amazon EFS created when it created the mount target.
--
-- * 'mtdOwnerId' - AWS account ID that owns the resource.
--
-- * 'mtdMountTargetId' - System-assigned mount target ID.
--
-- * 'mtdFileSystemId' - The ID of the file system for which the mount target is intended.
--
-- * 'mtdSubnetId' - The ID of the mount target's subnet.
--
-- * 'mtdLifeCycleState' - Lifecycle state of the mount target.
