-- | Creates a value of 'MetricDataResult' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mdrValues' - The data points for the metric corresponding to @Timestamps@ . The number of values always matches the number of timestamps and the timestamp for Values[x] is Timestamps[x].
--
-- * 'mdrId' - The short name you specified to represent this metric.
--
-- * 'mdrTimestamps' - The timestamps for the data points, formatted in Unix timestamp format. The number of timestamps always matches the number of values and the value for Timestamps[x] is Values[x].
--
-- * 'mdrMessages' - A list of messages with additional information about the data returned.
--
-- * 'mdrLabel' - The human-readable label associated with the data.
--
-- * 'mdrStatusCode' - The status of the returned data. @Complete@ indicates that all data points in the requested time range were returned. @PartialData@ means that an incomplete set of data points were returned. You can use the @NextToken@ value that was returned and repeat your request to get more data points. @NextToken@ is not returned if you are performing a math expression. @InternalError@ indicates that an error occurred. Retry your request using @NextToken@ , if present.
