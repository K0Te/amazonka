-- | Creates a value of 'InsightRuleMetricDatapoint' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'irmdMaxContributorValue' - The maximum value provided by one contributor during this timestamp. Each timestamp is evaluated separately, so the identity of the max contributor could be different for each timestamp. This statistic is returned only if you included it in the @Metrics@ array in your request.
--
-- * 'irmdSampleCount' - The number of occurrences that matched the rule during this data point. This statistic is returned only if you included it in the @Metrics@ array in your request.
--
-- * 'irmdMaximum' - The maximum value from a single occurence from a single contributor during the time period represented by that data point. This statistic is returned only if you included it in the @Metrics@ array in your request.
--
-- * 'irmdAverage' - The average value from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point. This statistic is returned only if you included it in the @Metrics@ array in your request.
--
-- * 'irmdMinimum' - The minimum value from a single contributor during the time period represented by that data point. This statistic is returned only if you included it in the @Metrics@ array in your request.
--
-- * 'irmdUniqueContributors' - The number of unique contributors who published data during this timestamp. This statistic is returned only if you included it in the @Metrics@ array in your request.
--
-- * 'irmdSum' - The sum of the values from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point. This statistic is returned only if you included it in the @Metrics@ array in your request.
--
-- * 'irmdTimestamp' - The timestamp of the data point.
