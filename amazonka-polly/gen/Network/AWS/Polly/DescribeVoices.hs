-- Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name. 
--
--
-- When synthesizing speech ( @SynthesizeSpeech@ ), you provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by @DescribeVoices@ .
--
-- For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the @DescribeVoices@ operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from.
--
-- You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify @en-US@ , the operation returns a list of all available US English voices. 
--
-- This operation requires permissions to perform the @polly:DescribeVoices@ action.
--
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeVoices' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dvLanguageCode' - The language identification tag (ISO 639 code for the language name-ISO 3166 country code) for filtering the list of voices returned. If you don't specify this optional parameter, all available voices are returned. 
--
-- * 'dvEngine' - Specifies the engine (@standard@ or @neural@ ) used by Amazon Polly when processing input text for speech synthesis. 
--
-- * 'dvNextToken' - An opaque pagination token returned from the previous @DescribeVoices@ operation. If present, this indicates where to continue the listing.
--
-- * 'dvIncludeAdditionalLanguageCodes' - Boolean value indicating whether to return any bilingual voices that use the specified language as an additional language. For instance, if you request all languages that use US English (es-US), and there is an Italian voice that speaks both Italian (it-IT) and US English, that voice will be included if you specify @yes@ but not if you specify @no@ .
