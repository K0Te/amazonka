-- | Creates a value of 'Voice' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'vLanguageCode' - Language code of the voice.
--
-- * 'vLanguageName' - Human readable name of the language in English.
--
-- * 'vGender' - Gender of the voice.
--
-- * 'vName' - Name of the voice (for example, Salli, Kendra, etc.). This provides a human readable voice name that you might display in your application.
--
-- * 'vId' - Amazon Polly assigned voice ID. This is the ID that you specify when calling the @SynthesizeSpeech@ operation.
--
-- * 'vAdditionalLanguageCodes' - Additional codes for languages available for the specified voice in addition to its default language.  For example, the default language for Aditi is Indian English (en-IN) because it was first used for that language. Since Aditi is bilingual and fluent in both Indian English and Hindi, this parameter would show the code @hi-IN@ .
--
-- * 'vSupportedEngines' - Specifies which engines (@standard@ or @neural@ ) that are supported by a given voice.
