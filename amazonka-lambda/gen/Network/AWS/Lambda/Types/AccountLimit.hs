-- | Creates a value of 'AccountLimit' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'alConcurrentExecutions' - The maximum number of simultaneous function executions.
--
-- * 'alTotalCodeSize' - The amount of storage space that you can use for all deployment packages and layer archives.
--
-- * 'alUnreservedConcurrentExecutions' - The maximum number of simultaneous function executions, minus the capacity that's reserved for individual functions with 'PutFunctionConcurrency' .
--
-- * 'alCodeSizeUnzipped' - The maximum size of a function's deployment package and layers when they're extracted.
--
-- * 'alCodeSizeZipped' - The maximum size of a deployment package when it's uploaded directly to AWS Lambda. Use Amazon S3 for larger files.
