-- | Creates a value of 'EventSourceMappingConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'esmcEventSourceARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event source.
--
-- * 'esmcState' - The state of the event source mapping. It can be one of the following: @Creating@ , @Enabling@ , @Enabled@ , @Disabling@ , @Disabled@ , @Updating@ , or @Deleting@ .
--
-- * 'esmcStartingPositionTimestamp' - With @StartingPosition@ set to @AT_TIMESTAMP@ , the time from which to start reading.
--
-- * 'esmcFunctionARN' - The ARN of the Lambda function.
--
-- * 'esmcTopics' - The name of the Kafka topic.
--
-- * 'esmcQueues' - (MQ) The name of the Amazon MQ broker destination queue to consume. 
--
-- * 'esmcBisectBatchOnFunctionError' - (Streams) If the function returns an error, split the batch in two and retry. The default value is false.
--
-- * 'esmcUUId' - The identifier of the event source mapping.
--
-- * 'esmcParallelizationFactor' - (Streams) The number of batches to process from each shard concurrently. The default value is 1.
--
-- * 'esmcLastProcessingResult' - The result of the last AWS Lambda invocation of your Lambda function.
--
-- * 'esmcMaximumRetryAttempts' - (Streams) Discard records after the specified number of retries. The default value is infinite (-1). When set to infinite (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires.
--
-- * 'esmcBatchSize' - The maximum number of items to retrieve in a single batch.
--
-- * 'esmcStateTransitionReason' - Indicates whether the last change to the event source mapping was made by a user, or by the Lambda service.
--
-- * 'esmcMaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds' - (Streams and SQS standard queues) The maximum amount of time to gather records before invoking the function, in seconds. The default value is zero.
--
-- * 'esmcSourceAccessConfigurations' - An array of the authentication protocol, or the VPC components to secure your event source.
--
-- * 'esmcMaximumRecordAgeInSeconds' - (Streams) Discard records older than the specified age. The default value is infinite (-1). When set to infinite (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires.
--
-- * 'esmcFunctionResponseTypes' - (Streams) A list of current response type enums applied to the event source mapping.
--
-- * 'esmcTumblingWindowInSeconds' - (Streams) The duration of a processing window in seconds. The range is between 1 second up to 15 minutes.
